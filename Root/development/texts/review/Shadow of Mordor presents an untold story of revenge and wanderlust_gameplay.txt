Swift combat and remarkable characters help bring the lore-driven story to life. With the option to progress the game at any pace, it would take over 15 hours to complete the storyline – excluding the side missions.<br />
<br />
Featuring similar mechanics to the Batman: Arkham series, Shadow of Mordor delivers an impressive combat system that is extremely responsive. Like Batman, Talion can use the environment to his advantage - to hide, strike or even manipulate NPCs.  <br />
<br />
With heightened abilities from his wraith ally, Talion can slay enemies with a gnarly sword, mystic bow and a stealthy dagger. Each approach carries its own risks and rewards. By focusing on enemies’ vulnerabilities, fights become easier and strategic. <br />
<br />
However, Shadow of Mordor is no suicidal conquest, players must find a balance when it comes to challenging a multitude of enemies – an overwhelming amount would require skills to muster.<br />
<br />
Loading times were frustratingly long, however once the level had been processed, it was a delight to dish up a few corpses. Aside from the nitpicking, the time spent on character details was superb; every orc was as ugly and unique as the last.<br />
<br />
Side questing and slaughtering orcs for experience is extremely satisfying. Every fight is different due to the randomised strengths and weaknesses of each captain. Some will run, others will have reinforcements to distract you. Challenges are never far away.<br />
