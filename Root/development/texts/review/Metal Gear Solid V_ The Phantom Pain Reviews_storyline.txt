After the explosive events of Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Phantom Pain continues nine years later, after Big Boss wakens from a coma in 1984. After escaping an assassination attempt in the hospital (which is perhaps the most incredible intro to any game I’ve ever played), he reunites with Revolver Ocelot and Kazuhira Miller, who aim to rebuild the army they lost to Skull Face – the main antagonist of the game. <br />

As expected from an MGS game, there are an inordinate amount of twists and turns – each one crazier than the last. Unlike previous games though, cutscenes are sparser, with much of the exposition conveyed through cassette tapes. I actually liked this change of pace (despite some protestations online), but I took greater issue with the unsatisfactory way many of the story threads were left hanging. It was clear that the plot suffered during development – possibly due to the aforementioned Konami/Kojima woes. Still, it was nevertheless memorable.<br />
