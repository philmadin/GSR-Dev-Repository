At this stage, while the game is buggy, Just Cause 3 is full of physics bugs and constant game crashes. The gameplay itself, however, is the Alexis Ren of action games. The wing-suit takes a little too long to learn, but anyone with a couple of hours in the game will tell you that the cool stuff you can do makes it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Basically every system or mechanic from Just Cause 2 has been brought back and drastically improved, and though it has been criticised for conforming to many modern open world game trends, they only serve to enrich the experience in JC3. <br />
<br />
Driving physics have been fixed since JC2, although trying to control a motorcycle is absolutely dreadful.<br />
<br />
As always with Just Cause, the map is freaking huge and is a delight to manifest in. The many easter eggs are an essential addition to this constant joyride. Dying is essentially the only challenge the overpowered Rico has to face, although this is easy to avoid.<br />
<br />
Overall, the changes from Just Cause 2 have been for the better, but the franchise is weighed down by the same issues as always - the missions feel repetitive, the bike driving is crap, and the physics doesn’t quite do what it’s supposed to.
