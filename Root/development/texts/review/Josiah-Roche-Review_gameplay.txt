The replay value of this game is incredibly unforgiving - with no save or load options, each choice you make will define the end game. 

With incredible events, players get to explore this massive open-world game - which is at least 4000 times larger than that of Skyrim. Players can travel the gameworld in multiple vehicles, can perform thousands of actions and can drink coffee! Lotsa Coffee!!  

Over the course of this game, you encounter enemies, friends, love, job opportunities, and loss. Pretty average conceptually, yet this gameplay is presented with great polish.
