A great soundtrack is key to any Need for Speed game and they have nailed it. Each track adds to the heart racing suspense while travelling around the city. If only there were more songs that could be added. Cars sound mostly great to the untrained ear and changes can be heard as they are upgraded. <br />

The acting is cheesy and is a minor let-down for the game. Some of the lines are cringe-worthy but thankfully can be skipped to go back to the action.<br />
