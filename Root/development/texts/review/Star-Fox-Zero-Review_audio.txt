The N64 voice cast returns, and they even spout many of the same lines. Intriguingly, dialogue is only heard through the GamePad's speakers, and is presented via a neat '3D' effect. This is a surprisingly cool method, and I didn't miss the 'traditional' way at all.

Music is also remixed from the past, and combat is suitably explosive. It's Star Fox, all right.
