Anyone who has played Destiny knows that recycled content is fairly common. The Taken King has made a strong effort to rectify this but hasn't been entirely successful. <br />

The Taken enemies are also not entirely new. The Taken consist of pre-existing races, Fallen, Hive, Vex and Cabal, but with glowing spectral skin. In combat the Taken feel different, but visually it’s hard to forget that you’re just fighting the same enemies dyed in another colour…
