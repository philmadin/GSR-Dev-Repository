The main story alone will easily take 50+ hours to complete and sees you as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, on the trail of his lover Yennefer and his adopted daughter Ciri. It’s unfortunate that so much of the game early on is spent doing favors for people in an attempt to gain new information on their whereabouts. The fascinating characters you’ll encounter, old friends and lovers, scheming witches, underworld bosses and corrupt kings always seem more interesting than Geralt’s cross-country pursuit.<br />
<br />
Because of this, the main quest line is the very definition of a slow burn and if you focus too much on the fetch-quest heavy objectives, you’re likely to burn out. The beauty of the game lies in your ability to set your own trail and how the seemingly never-ending list of side quests tie into the overall story. One of the coolest things to witness is to make what you think is an insignificant decision only to later find out your actions have impacted the main story and the communities around you. <br />

The world you ride in, over three times the size of Skyrim, fast becomes a joy to revel in as you chase monsters across the land. Most missions, even those found on the beaten path, feel handcrafted and designed just for you to forge your own story. <br />
