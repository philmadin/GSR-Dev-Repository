All the visuals included in Rocket League are aesthetically appealing and contain surprising amounts of detail. This is most noticeable in the extensive vehicle customisation.<br />

The ability to decorate your car with different builds as well as with hats and add ons look fantastic both up close and during games. The Fallout 4 Vault-Tec bobblehead as my antenna is a guilty pleasure of mine. <br />

The explosion of the game ball when a goal is scored looks authentic and the rocket trails you can attach to your cars are incredibly crisp. These can range from gooey slime to elegant snowflakes to plasma trails.<br />
