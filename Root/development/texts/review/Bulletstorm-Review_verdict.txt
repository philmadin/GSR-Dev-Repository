I had loads of fun playing Bulletstorm, and it definitely has plenty on offer for any FPS fan, and Grayson’s leash gives this game a refreshing but over-the top experience when compared to a traditional FPS<br />
The story may be a little predictable and cliché for some people, but the creative “Kill with Skill” combat system made up for any dull bits through out the game. <br />
<br />
It took me about eight hours to finish the main story. And even though Bulletstorm is a few years old now, I would still definitely recommend giving it a play through.<br />
