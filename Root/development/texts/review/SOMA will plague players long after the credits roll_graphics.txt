One of the unusual aspects of Soma is a colour distortion effect that changes what Simon sees based on his health. This can be fixed by finding one of the health stations spread out all across the station or the feature can simply be disabled for those unable to handle it. <br />

Soma may have less-than-stellar graphics but there is a great attention to details in the environment and almost all items can be handled in some way. The PlayStation 4 version suffers from minor pauses while auto-saving, which can become annoying when save points are close together. The only other problem suffered during play was from a cut scene freeze.
