The audio in SUPERHOT is barely there. There are gunshots, the red dudes make shattering sounds as they die and the CRT styled menu clicks and beeps. None of it sounds bad but it's more atmospheric than anything else. There isn't even a soundtrack. While it often feels empty it does seem as if the devs aimed to create an empty dissonance and at this they succeeded.&nbsp; <br><br>While there isn't a lot of audio what's there is enough to deliver the audio feedback that's needed. Nothing less, nothing more.<br>
