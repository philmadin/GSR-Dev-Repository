After being airlifted to a secret location embedded with glacial mountains, Agent 47 first meets the agency. With a troubling memory, 47 allows the agency to test him, calibrating his operational skills with in-house assassination trials. <br />

These advanced training assignments are hosted within the agency in a simulation tank.<br />
<br />
47 must complete these assassinations in skilful ways, while being tested in realistic (well…if fake wooden yachts count) environments.
