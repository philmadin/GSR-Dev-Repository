<i>UFC 2</i> offers some of the best mixed martial arts fighting simulations that have ever been seen in a video game. The striking is fast and fluid, the knock outs are brutal and the submissions are slick.<p><i>UFC 1</i> was praised for its accurate depiction of stand up fighting but was also equally criticized due to its uninspired grappling system.

Submissions, ground fighting and clinch work have all been upgraded with a much more visually appealing &nbsp;layout.&nbsp;</p><p>The fights themselves are incredibly fun and look like real UFC fights but there are still noteworthy omissions that take away from new players looking to join the fight.
