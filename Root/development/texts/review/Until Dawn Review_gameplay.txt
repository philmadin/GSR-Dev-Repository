Utilising PS4’s DualShock 4 controller, players can immerse themselves in the game with intuitive controls. DualShock’s touchpad allows players to flick through pages in books or light lanterns and even the slightest movement during a tense moment can cause repercussions. One of the most centrepiece mechanics of Until Dawn is “The Butterfly Effect”, this is when a player chooses a path which will impact their end-game. With a strict auto-save feature, restarting the game or finishing it, is the only way to alter the current timeline.<br />

Until Dawn plays similarly to The Walking Dead in the way decisions can be made with quick time events to keep players on their toes; it’s easy to fail in these moments and it can leave players feeling frustrated. One of the most disappointing factors of this game is the lack of camera intuitiveness, namely the aiming invert function. Players that are conditioned to the camera settings will find that it is a matter of life or death if they are able to perform the action in time. <br />
