When it comes to single player Rocket League is unfortunately bare boned but this is attributed to its primary focus as a competitive multiplayer experience. <br />
<br />
When riding solo the player has the option to take part in a "season mode" of varying difficulty against AI controlled opposition. This coupled with the single-player tutorial modes allow for new players to learn the ropes before taking on human opponents. <br />
<br />
These aren't the modes that will keep you coming back to the game but they are an integral part of the initial learning experience of such beautiful chaos.
