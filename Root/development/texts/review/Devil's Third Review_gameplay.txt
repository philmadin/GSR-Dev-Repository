As the format suggests, gameplay is primarily cover shooting combined with hack n’ slash action. Hailed as a revolutionary fusion between the two styles by Itagaki, the final product is in fact underwhelming and mediocre. Gunplay feels stiff, essentially requiring aim-assist, and melee combat is relegated to quick/strong attacks, blocking and cinematic kills. <br />

Nothing new here; just genre tropes like regenerating health, linear routes, and plentiful checkpoints all expectedly present. Still, if you’re looking for some brainless fun, you could do worse – and collectables in each level bring some replay value to the game, as well as the score attack mode.<br />

The online multiplayer mode is perhaps the best part of Devil’s Third. It’s incredibly detailed and comprehensive, with some genuinely original ideas. Upon creating a character, you need to choose which part of post-apocalyptic America you reside in – which is the only choice for Australian users (such as myself). <br />
<br />
Then, you need to join a clan, create your own or become a mercenary. From there on, you can partake in the wide variety of modes that range from traditional (deathmatch, King of the Hill, etc) to creative (catching chickens, tossing fruit into a blender). Playing earns you ‘Dollen’ to spend of weapons, equipment and clothing. On top of this, you can create your own base (which can be invaded), negotiate treaties with other clans, and even spread propaganda fliers! <br />

It really is comprehensive – but a couple of things mar the experience. First, micro transactions really spoil things, making life more difficult for players who refuse to shell out the extra cash. Also, a free-to-play version is coming to PC, which is a real gut-punch to those who already paid for the Wii U edition.
