For such a huge game to hold your attention for the hundreds of hours it offers, many gameplay mechanics and systems are intricately designed. That the game is brave enough to let you discover its secrets and eccentricities on your own and doesn’t baby you through its alchemy, crafting and equipment systems, is a testament to how well they open up to you when you find you’re ready and willing to use them. <br />

Most of your time is spent questing, using brilliant combat mechanics that feel badass when you get the hang of them. You’ll be fighting with an array of magical abilities and a parry system similar to the Assassins Creed games albeit one much more methodical. The combat is grounded in your own reflexes and not the counter icons that appear on screen. You’ll also use your ‘Witcher Senses’, similar to the Arkham series’ ‘Detective Vision’ to solve puzzles and crime scene-esque scenarios to progress. <br />
