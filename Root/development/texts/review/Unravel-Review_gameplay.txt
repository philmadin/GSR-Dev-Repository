Being formed of yarn, you are always connected to the beginning of the level. Progression either in a straight line or coiling yourself around a tree branch will cause you to expend your supply of yarn and ultimately be left yarnless. Along the way you will encounter spools of yarn that you can resupply with, also acting as checkpoints. Unless you make a severe error in judgment, you’ll never really run out of yarn, but if you do it’s easy to backtrack and right the mistake. In fact, with all the yarn flying around to solve puzzles and interact with the world, it works really well.<br />

Yarny himself is a bit clumsy to handle and in a game that requires fine manipulation, it’s often annoying at how inaccurate he can be. His movements can be sluggish when you need to be quick and many a death will occur due to things that could really have been avoided in one attempt. In fact, dying in Unravel seems to be expected regularly. Many puzzles seem to require you to die in order to learn. We all know the series where this can be effective, but here? Not so much.
