Each game follows the story of Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter, who often is in danger as he unravels mysteries around the world. <br />
<br />
Uncharted: Drakes Fortune is about Nathan finding the lost treasure of El Dorado with his mentor Victor Sullivan and journalist Elena Fisher. The story may feel cliché at times, borrowing ideas from the likes of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider, but, the familiarity only enhances the game. Drake's humour and banter with other characters delivers relief between the many action filled sequences. <br />
<br />
Drake's story continues in Uncharted: Among Thieves. Inspired by the travels of Marco Polo, Nathan must travel around the world to find the Cintimani Stone. Naughty Dog stepped up their game with better storytelling, weaving in more history, while concentrating on character relationships. The story is near perfect with great pacing and a balance of cliffhanger moments to keep the player hooked till the end.<br />
<br />
Uncharted 3: Drakes Deception looks closely at the friendship between Drake and Sully as they search for a legendary lost city. This game felt rushed and disjointed. Questions were left unanswered and the story felt like it was an afterthought to everything else. While the game explores Drakes past, it falters with his present adventure, as everything was quickly resolved. <br />
<br />
The collection highlights Drake and his story in all the right ways, allowing players to see the character evolve into the icon he is today.
