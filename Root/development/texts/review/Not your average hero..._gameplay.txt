Swift combat and remarkable characters help bring the lore-driven story to life. With the option to progress the game at any pace, it would take over 15 hours to complete the storyline – excluding the side missions.<br />
<br />
Featuring similar mechanics to the Batman: Arkham series, Shadow of Mordor delivers an impressive combat system that is extremely responsive. Like Batman, Talion can use the environment to his advantage - to hide, strike or even manipulate NPCs.  <br />
<br />
With heightened abilities from his wraith ally, Talion can slay enemies with a gnarly sword, mystic bow and a stealthy dagger. Each approach carries its own risks and rewards. By focusing on enemies’ vulnerabilities, fights become easier and strategic. <br />
<br />
However, Shadow of Mordor is no suicidal conquest, players must find a balance when it comes to challenging a multitude of enemies – an overwhelming amount would require skills to muster.<br />
