From the movement of a Spartan hoisting his or her rifle to the climax of battle, the sound design is a treat. Everything is detailed, clear and meaty. The soundtrack feels much more Halo than the previous instalment, striking a good balance between the old and new. The Halo theme returns after a hiatus but it isn’t pounded into your eardrums for the hundredth time. Instead, it has been varied and built upon to create a soundtrack with its own identity.<br />
