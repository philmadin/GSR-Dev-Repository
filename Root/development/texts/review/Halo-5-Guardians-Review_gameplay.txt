Halo is Halo, it will always be familiar at least in some small way. This time is no different but there are plenty of small additions to give the game a unique identity. Regardless of the character you play in the story you are able to command your squad to do all sorts of small tasks and position themselves where you deem fit. It feels very smooth and on higher difficulties it became almost second nature to order my team around. The loss of spilt screen cooperative modes will leave some, perhaps many, saddened. Despite this, the removal of the function does make at least some iota of sense, given the widespread use of online gaming.<br />

For many gamers, competitive multiplayer is where it’s at. Old modes such as Team Slayer are back and for the most part they feel exactly like they always have, but with more varied combat mechanics. You may decide to “Charge” into someone mid sprint or crash down on them from above with the “Ground Pound”. The newest addition to the Multiplayer scene is with Warzone. The game mode allows twenty-four people to fight against not only an opposing team of Spartans but also Promethean and Covenant forces that spawn in throughout the match. Killing these enemies grants extra points for your team. It’s a fun idea and is a more relaxed way of spending your online time.
