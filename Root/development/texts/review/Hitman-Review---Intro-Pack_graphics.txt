To be honest, the graphics weren't that much different to its predecessor. Yes, HITMAN is upgraded in many ways using the upgraded Glacier engine - which is boasted to have every system improved in the engine - but the graphics didn't give me the wow-factor that I was looking for. Nonetheless, the game is stunningly beautiful.  <br />
