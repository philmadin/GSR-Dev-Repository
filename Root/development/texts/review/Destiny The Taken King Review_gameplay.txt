One of Destiny’s biggest strengths has always been its gameplay and The Taken King is no exception. Three new subclasses have been introduced alongside new weapons and armour, composing of unique and formidable abilities. Whilst some new abilities feel overpowered - such as Stormtrance for Warlocks; they don’t feel any more dominant than the previous subclasses. <br />

Another newish feature is an enemy race called The Taken, which is a possessed version of the current enemies – not particularly an innovative move from Bungie. Difficult and obnoxious, The Taken can be very frustrating additions to an already crowded environment.
