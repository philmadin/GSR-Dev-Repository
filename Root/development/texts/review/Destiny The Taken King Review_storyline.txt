The Taken King's narrative is an improvement over the previous instalments. Following Crota’s death at the hands of the Guardians, his father Oryx arrives unexpectedly in an enormous Dreadnaught. <br />
<br />
Now, on a zealous rampage, Oryx seeks revenge for his son and builds an army of corrupted foes to defeat the Guardians. The story is more coherent, focused and has a flair that’s been missing since the days of Halo.<br />
<br />
Taken King’s cutscenes give players insight into the charismatic characters of Destiny; with humorous and quippy monologues, players are more informed of what’s actually going on behind the red tape.
