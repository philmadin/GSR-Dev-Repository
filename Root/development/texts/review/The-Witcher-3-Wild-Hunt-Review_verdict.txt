For the same reason that later Assassins Creed titles feel bloated, their maps littered with objective markers pushing you to collect items and check everything off, Wild Hunt offers the same, if not more amount of content but doesn’t shove it in your face and is all the more exciting for it. To stand atop a mountain at sunset and look at the world around you, knowing that everything you see is there for you to explore, is a feat only the elder scrolls series has done so eloquently before it. The moment when you realise just how mammoth the game is but that most of it will sit undiscovered and untainted until you journey through it, is awe-inspiring.<br />

Aside from an overly-long and drawn out main quest line that takes too long to really heat up, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece of open-world design and overall storytelling. Hundreds of hours of content are packed away just waiting to be blazed through. The only real fault is that to get everything the game has to offer, you’ll just have to be patient enough to sink into it.
