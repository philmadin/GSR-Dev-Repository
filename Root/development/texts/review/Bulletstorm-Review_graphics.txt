Despite the odd texture not loading during a cutscene and the occasional frame rate drop, Bulletstorm looks beyond respectable for a five year old game. <br />
Though I believe character movement could be quite jagged sometimes and there was too much happening on the screen at times leaving enemies difficult to focus on.<br />

Developers have put a great amount of detail into the level designs, effecting in a very well executed interactive world, leaving this game with excellent game play and a terrific atmosphere.<br />
