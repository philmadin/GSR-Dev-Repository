Leo’s fortune has been stolen! He writes his wife a note and sets out in search of the thief who stole his treasure. The plot does expand upon this through small intervals that allow Leo himself to detail, in his ageing Mexican Accent, thoughts and suspicions as to who stole his fortune and why.<br />

The narrative is soft and easily digestible, providing a tidy little moral that isn’t overbearing. Perfect for a youthful audience.
