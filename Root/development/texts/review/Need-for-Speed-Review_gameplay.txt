This is where the game shines. From the beginning, the player can customise their car to the style they like, in order to win. There is no hand holding. By changing the handling style, the car will become better at certain races like drifting or time attacks and worse in others. Having a balanced car is not always the way forward. It is encouraged, by the game, to have more than one car so the player can be competitive.   <br />

In order to progress, the player must earn reputation and money to open more races, car parts and story; there are multiple paths to achieve this. The player can focus on what they are good at. Although, it is recommended to be able to drift to compete in the final races of the game.<br />

One of the disappointing parts of the game is how the courses are highlighted. Without constant reference to the small mini-map, it is difficult to follow the blue arrows that direct the way. As the game is mostly based at night, obstacles and corners are even harder to see and can cause an unnecessary restart. Besides some small flaws, most of the game is well balanced and fun.<br />
