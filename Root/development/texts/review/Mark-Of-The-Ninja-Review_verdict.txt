Ninja is a marvel visually, aurally, and in stealth gameplay. A wide array of tools at the player’s disposal creates many different play styles and options, and while guards are sometimes too easy to handle, the maps compensate for this with challenge, exploration, and non-linear options.<br />

A simple yet novel approach to stealth as well as a wide array of tools and options means replayability. The storyline and incredible audio help to immerse the player. I would recommend Mark Of The Ninja to anyone who likes stealth, platformers, or scaring guards to death with the bodies of their fallen brothers.
