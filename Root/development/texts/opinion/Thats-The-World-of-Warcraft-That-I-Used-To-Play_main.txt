The current life of a World of Warcraft player has more or less turned into running around for five minutes making the most out of your bona fide FarmVille gameplay and repetitive daily quests, before you ask yourself the timeless question of why you’re still playing this game. <br />
<br />
My experience with World of Warcraft is similar to many of those that play; a story of memories made with good friends and likeminded gamers. It is a game which has led to the formation of lifelong friends - and in some cases the catalyst of marriages. I don’t think it is any secret that the community environment was one of the major driving forces that forged the worldwide success of Blizzard Entertainment’s debut MMORPG. Released in 2004, the game was the best-selling PC game concurrently in 2005 and 2006. As well as this, the game holds the record for the being the most popular MMORPG based off of subscriber numbers, plateauing in 2010 with over 12 million. <br />
<br />
However, to quote the words of rapper Rich Boy: “good things don’t last forever”. Following the release of Blizzard’s latest expansion, Warlords of Draenor, subscriber numbers have plummeted to below 5.6 million in June 2015, the lowest since 2005. Within the WoW community there has been speculation as to what has accelerated the death of this once grandiose game and this has led many to question if the game will make it to its 20th anniversary.<br />
<br />
I feel the key to answering this question can be found in a statement made by WoW lead game director Ion Hazikostas in a 2014 interview saying, “The person who picked up the game in 2004 who was a student with tons of free time is now a career person with a family and they're trying to fit in 60-90 minutes of game time after the kids go to bed at night”. There is some truth to this statement in that Blizzard has continued to follow their original target demographic into adulthood instead of sticking to their guns and maintaining development towards gameplay which will attract new players to the game. <br />
<br />
Instead of pushing new players to adventure the vast world that Blizzard have created (a world which has been traversed by over 100 million players) they are entering a world with FarmVille-esque gameplay, endgame raiding progression akin to running on a treadmill and a community where players don’t even have to interact with each other to kill the last boss in the game. Let that sink in, an MMORPG where players can finish current content without needing to or be pushed to interact with other players. Where’s the community in that? <br />
<br />
Even though it has been an attempt at innovation by Blizzard, the integration of the garrison system proved to be the major downfall in the latest expansion. The system draws away from the social aspect of the game and forces players to focus their game time solely on garrison content. This reduction in player to player interaction with the lack of world content has caused many to hang up their greaves and wait until Blizzard gives them a reason to play again.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt this expansion has been the most drama-filled yet, with major debacles from content being cut close to launch, horrid connection issues on release and dilemmas with the re-implementation of in-game flying. Along with the pulling of promised content mid-expansion and complaints of money grabbing behaviour from Blizzard with the in game store, a large level of distrust has brewed within the community. <br />
<br />
From an observational point of view it appears that Blizzard is biting the bullet on this one, and as such have begun to push all their resources into their next expansion. This was evident in a recent interview with French website mamytwink.com. when Lead Game Designer Cory Stockton announced that the Hellfire Citadel raid will be the last of the expansions. The early announcement of Legion at Gamescom 2015 instead of their comfortable stomping grounds at BlizzCon shows that the red emergency button has very much been pressed at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
The surge in subscribers with the November 2014 release of Warlords of Draenor was reminiscent of the game’s 2010 heydays. It proves that there is still an interest in the game from both former and new players. The upcoming Legion expansion provides Blizzard an opportunity to save this Titanic and go back to its roots, but yet still appeal to a new player base. Albeit a challenging task for Blizzard, their recent swell in their game development team will aid in their mission to return the game to its former glory and prove why it has been the number one MMORPG for the last decade.<br />
