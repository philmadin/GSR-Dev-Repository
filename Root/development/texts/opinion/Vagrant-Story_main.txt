Vagrant Story is a ground-breaking Squaresoft title of the late PS1 gaming era. As a spin-off from the Final Fantasy universe, the story of this game takes place within a Kingdom based in the late Final Fantasy XII, known as "Valendia". <br />
<br />
The story centers on Ashley Riot, an elite agent known as a "Riskbreaker", who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader (Sydney Losstarot) and a senior Valendian Parliament member, Duke Bardorba. In the prologue, Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke, and the game discloses the events that happens one week before the murder.<br />
<br />
The diverse gaming mechanics turn a linear dungeon crawler into so much more. Vagrant Story is unique from most games of its genre in that there are no shop systems and no direct interactions with other characters in-game. Alternatively, the game focuses on weapon creation and modification, as well as elements of puzzle-solving and strategy. <br />
<br />
Gameplay could be compared to an amalgamation of Parasite Eve, Metal Gear Solid, and even what would soon come to be Square's Final Fantasy XII title. General movement throughout the dungeon floors is free-roaming, where as combat tactics freeze-lock movement while you figure out the best approach to the battle. <br />
<br />
Magic and other special abilities are acquired later throughout the game; choose whichever best suits your playing style and strategy as the options are provided to you throughout the game.<br />
If an unparraleled story and heavily tactical playing style is what you seek from your RPG gaming fix, then look no further than this beautiful gem; Vagrant Story.<br />
