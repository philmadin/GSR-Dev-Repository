What do you get when you take lovable comic book characters, top-down squad-based combat, and a cheesy plot full of time travel, magic, and aliens? Freedom Force, A massively underrated game series from Bioshock developers, Irrational Games.<br />
<br />
Freedom Force was Irrational Games’ campy 2002 take on the Golden Age of Superheroes. The similarly ridiculous yet amazing sequel, Freedom Force VS The Third Reich, was released ten years ago. These days, the only press FF gets is from people who played it when they were younger, writing articles about whether it should have a reboot. (Ooh, meta.)<br />
<br />
As any of these articles will tell you, the games feature heroes created as homages and parodies of popular Marvel and DC superheroes such as Captain America and Batman, complete with ridiculous costumes, over-the-top voice acting, and flamboyant villains. Its’ plot goes from campy villains with campy agendas to campy time travel plot with a campy supervillain named Timemaster who believes himself to be the master of time (duh).<br />
<br />
And it’s brilliant.<br />
<br />
The story is interesting because it’s dumb – it’s a classic tale of good versus evil sprinkled with romance and time travel, ripped straight from the pages of a comic book. The characters based on others are different enough from the superheroes they parody to be interesting characters on their own, but some of the original characters are some of the best.<br />
<br />
As I touched on earlier, the franchise has been brought up repeatedly all over the web as a series due for a reboot – or at least worth a look by comic book fans who don’t already own the game. But… why?<br />
<br />
Why would anyone want to reboot a game which, by modern standards, has dreadful gameplay, but is still held in such high regard by many fans? Much like the original trilogy of Star Wars movies, or any of Arnie’s films, wouldn’t these masterpieces be best left alone and remembered as they are?<br />
<br />
As Oliver Lee Bateman says in his VICE article on Freedom Force, the gameplay is slow and somewhat tedious. But over the past decade, superhero films, TV shows, and games have all drastically improved. I would argue that almost every early superhero game was terrible, while today, superhero games like the Arkham franchises or Saints Row IV are best-sellers. <br />
<br />
My point is that gameplay can change. With one of the greatest character creators in any superhero game, and a fantastic cast of characters who clearly have so many stories left to tell, the series deserves more than to be thrown out on account of outdated gameplay.<br />
<br />
People don’t fondly remember Freedom Force for its’ RTS-with-pause gameplay. They remember the campy superheroes, the ridiculous villains, and the oddly charming story. Keep these elements (and the character creator please), and swap out the gameplay for something more interactive and fast-paced, such as a modern-day RPG that lets the player switch between a select few characters and “cast” their powers.<br />
<br />
Or port it to a new engine. I don’t care. I’ll probably buy it anyway.<br />
