With Dark Souls 3 ever so close, many of us will be sharpening our swords and opening our Fashion Souls closet to prepare for the next adventure. However, for many this will be their first time into the series and, in honour of the impending release, we’re going to go over all the previous bosses from Dark Souls and its sequel Dark Souls 2; to help prepare newcomers to the series and maybe even share some new knowledge to the experienced.

Dark Souls can be a very challenging game, this is no secret. What may surprise you though is that any class, any weapon and any set up is fully capable of reaching and defeating the final Boss. If you are looking for the best gear, the strongest weapon and most destructive spell, look inside your own inventory. Find a weapon that moves in a way you are comfortable with and simply upgrade it according to your personal stats. Those with the largest sword aren’t necessarily the most fearsome opponent, nor are those with the smallest dagger someone to be ignored. Find what works for you and stick with it.

Should you still find yourself struggling, remember to summon assistance through the use of your White Soapstone. And with that, we're off!

Good Luck, and Praise the Sun!
