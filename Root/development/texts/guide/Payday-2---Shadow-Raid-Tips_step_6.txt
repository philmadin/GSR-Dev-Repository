Don't use drills on the doors! In the warehouse, there are a couple of cage doors on both the first floor (which is where you can come out of the sewers) and the second floor (which you can enter via the stairs, the roof, or the ladder by the waterfront if that's spawned). To get in, you either need to drill in or you need keycards, but the number of guards that patrol nearby makes the former impractical.

If you've collected the minimum required number of loot bags, and you can't find any more in the main areas, at that point you might consider getting into these cages. But it is hard work to raid the map of all its' wares, so this rarely happens.

If you're playing on your own, you might consider using a keycard on these doors. But if you're playing with others, it may be worth saving a couple of keycards for the vault. These keycards need to be put into the lock almost simultaneously, but inside the vault is some samurai armour which you can break down into 4 valuable pieces.

Keycards are hard to find, but are often dropped by the guard in the security room (which is on the top floor and requires lockpicking) or by construction workers (if you take them as hostages, you may be detected, so consider killing them for a small penalty).
