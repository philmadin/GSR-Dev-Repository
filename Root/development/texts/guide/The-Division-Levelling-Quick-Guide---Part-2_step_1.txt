<h3>Weapons</h3> 

You are absolutely open to pick and choose whatever weapons you prefer, the only advice I can really give is this:

If you’re planning on spending any time playing solo, go for an SMG or an Assault Rifle for Primary use and a Sniper Rifle Secondary. 

Always remember that the slower the Sniper Rifle the larger the damage. Bolt-action packs the heaviest punch. This will give you the opportunity to clear out enemies from a distance and make adjustments as they get closer to finish them off.

If playing in a group, then the same tips apply that were talked about in the builds section – synergy with your team is key! Have someone play the role of the long distance marksman/sniper. 

Get someone else on LMG duty to help suppress enemies and provide support with skills that help fill this role. Get some run'n'gunners using SMG’s or Assault Rifles.

Refrain from using two weapons of the same type – you’re only going to run out of ammo twice as fast.
