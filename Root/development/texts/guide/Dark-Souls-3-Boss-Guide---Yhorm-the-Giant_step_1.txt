<h3>Yhorm The Giant</h3>

Not as dangerous as you might think. 

From the beginning, sprint to his throne and pick up the weapon, Storm Ruler. Yes, it is possible to do damage to Yhorm without it, but you’ll need about half an hour free. With Storm Ruler, you can charge up the weapon as a weapon art, then when Yhorm is recovering from a miss, release Storm Rulers power and cause heavy damage to him.

It’s really just that simple. Dodge his attacks, and attack with Storm Ruler, you’ll need to hit him about six times to kill him. Of course, this is a Boss so he isn’t here to party. His Great Machete is very dangerous and should it connect with you, will hurt a lot. But his attacks are telegraphed well and due to his size, you can simply run between his legs. Be careful not to charge Storm Ruler too hastily as Yhorm can still surprise you with his speed. If Yhorm catches you in the open trying to charge, especially in his second form, you’ll regret it.

For those that have seen Siegward of Catarina through in his storyline, you’ll be granted a small intro as Siegward enters the fray with you. He has his own Storm Ruler and combined with yours makes this fight extremely quick. 

Enjoy the demolition of Yhorm. Poor guy.
