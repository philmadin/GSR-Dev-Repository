Dismantle or Sell?
It’s generally advised that you should dismantle all of your unwanted gear/weapons as you will require the materials a lot more upon hitting max level.
 
Whilst I agree with this statement to a degree I actually prefer to mix it up a little bit. During my time levelling up my character I would wait until my bags were close to full and alternate between selling and dismantling gear per visit. My biggest reasoning for this is because I always try to keep my gear/weapons as close to my level as possible –within 5-6 levels maximum.
So every 5 levels I would go through my gear and replace the absolute lowest level gear/weapons with something equivalent to my level. If the difference became 7-8 levels then it would be an absolute must-upgrade slot. Alternating between dismantling and selling meant that I also had a steady cash flow so I could purchase anything from the vendors –that level 15 green that you might purchase from a vendor may do much more damage than the level 10 blue that you’re currently using! As you level you will find the vendors start to sell blue and even purple items –don’t worry about these while you’re levelling –they won’t last long and aren’t important in the scheme of things.
Keep this in mind if you plan on levelling fast –skill is always an important factor no matter what game you play –but having gear that is up to par is always going to give you that nice buffer and help boost your levelling speed.
