<h3>Velstadt, the Royal Aegis</h3> The Royal Aegis is a large, heavily armed, Dark imbued warrior protecting Vendrick.

Whilst certainly possible, this isn’t a fight that should be engaged with a shield. It may seem like a good idea but his attacks hit so hard that you’d likely just have your guard broken, not to mention you’d be best to use speed to your advantage. So, get used to rolling and learning his patterns. He carries the Scared Bell Chime Hammer that swings very slowly, especially at range. If you are struggling hang back and let him come to you.

The first half of the fight will require some practice to get used to his move set, which is a little odd. His mastery of the Hammer will catch new players off guard at times so no need to rush. As usual getting around behind him is effective but don’t linger as he can twirl his Hammer effectively enough to hit you from behind.

Survive the first half and he will crouch down and begin ringing his hammer. This is him buffing himself with Darkness. Once finished he will become about 40% more resistant to damage and will start to use a form of the Dark Hail Hex. Should he crouch down again he is trying to launch a wave of Dark Orbs at you that really hurt so as soon as you see him trying this, get behind him to evade their power and get a few free hits in.

Those with lightning abilities are going to have an easier time with Velstadt as he is weak to Lightning attacks. Have a Lightning Spear? Wait for an opening and hurl that baby for heavy damage.

Grave Warden Agdayne is up for hire just outside the entrance to the fight. His summon sign is quite close to the fog gate itself, next to one of the tomb pillars on the left hand side.
