Dark Sun Gwyndolin

Victory here will unfortunately incur a penalty for victory. Should you be successful, the Anor Londo Bonfire will become extinguished and the Gold Armoured Firekeeper will attack on sight from then on. Think carefully before stepping through the fog.

A bizarre fight to be sure, Gwyndolin will cause the room to constantly extend further and further backwards every time you get close. Get inside Gywyndolin’s  personal space and he will teleport further into the hallway.

Gwyndolin’s attacks are all ranged and can be extremely deadly. However he’s also very weak and easily out manoeuvred. His magic consists of a giant energy ball that goes through walls, a wave of smaller tracking orbs that can’t go through solid objects and his teleport. He also has a crossbow that fires a large amount of bolts in a row.

All you need to do is run towards him in a sort of zig zag whilst always moving closer until you can either run up and smash him with your weapon or lock on for a spell. That’s it, no real secret, he would be classified as a glass cannon, high damage, low resistance, so take advantage of that.

You may choose to stay at range with a bow, particularly a Greatbow. Stay far enough away that Gwyndolin won’t teleport, chuck on the Hawk Ring and simply fire arrows until victory. This can take a while so make sure you have plenty of arrows.
