<h3>Lud and Zallen, The King’s Pets</h3> Bit of a pattern isn’t there? One annoying boss for each expansion.

Lud and Zallen are two more giant tigers, like Aava, that live at the end of the Frigid Wastes. This fight is just as annoying as it sounds. Lud will engage you first, treat him exactly as you did Aava. Shortly after Lud attacks, Zallen will saunter on down to join. Together they make a rough combo and they won’t hesitate to follow each others paw swipes with more paw swipes, tagging you right after getting hit.

Their health pools are much lower than Aava so killing Lud super fast is critical. In fact, attempting this fight solo can actually be made so much easier by planning a demolishing assault on Lud quickly, killing him before Zallen can come down. If you aren’t confident with this method however there are three summons available from the beginning area of Frigid Wastes. With these three summons you will find managing two enemies much easier, you simply won’t be able to crush them as quickly.

Be wary, when one is dead and the second is low on health it will roar and buff itself, regenerating health somewhat quickly. It may even out heal the damage you are able to do to it, especially with summons.
