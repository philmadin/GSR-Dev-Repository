<h3>Pinwheel</h3> Regardless of when you fight Pinwheel he’s a bit of a joke. His attacks are magic and do a lot of damage especially to a low health character, however they are easy to evade and he is simple to hit for high damage. It’s unlikely you’ll suffer many deaths to this fellow, if any.

However, don’t let him live too long as he spawns copies of himself constantly that have the same powers he does. There may come a point where you’ll be overwhelmed with Pinwheels and not even know who the true Pinwheel is.

Should you feel the need, Paladin Leeroy is available to be summoned from outside the Boss arena. His sign can be reached by heading down to the Prowling/Titanite Demon’s location. In the area just outside where the skeletons and floating skulls are, jump down from the lower side and you should land just above the Skeleton Wheels.
