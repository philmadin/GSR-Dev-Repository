Patience and practise are key! Guards often stand in the same spot for long periods of time, so it may be tempting to race past behind them and hide before getting detected. But if you're in a safe area, patience will almost always pay off. I've failed Shadow Raid countless times because I was sick of waiting for a guard to move, so I raced away and ran straight into another guard or camera.

As you repeatedly try Shadow Raid, you'll learn more and more where guards patrol, where loot is kept, and how you want to tackle each room. Don't be afraid to fail, because it happens often, and it simply builds your experience with the map.
