<h3>Guardian Dragon</h3> Don’t let this Dragon's appearance scare you, he's fairly frail. Built like a Dragon but with the skin of a lizard, prepare yourself with fire resistant gear and don’t bother with a shield as speed is more useful.

When the fight begins your foe is having a nap, so run over and wake him up with a few hits if you’re careful. Don’t linger though as his head has some bizarre range when he bites and whenever you’re standing in front of him he’s likely going to try and nibble you.

His main attack is, naturally, a fire blast. It has two main forms one being a traditional flamethrower that he will breath in a variety of ways, the other being a fireball. This he’ll only use at a distance and from above. If he fires it get out of the way as the blast is fairly large.

Occasionally he will go into the air or latch to the side of the cage where he will blast fire down towards the floor. This has a very wide effect so when he goes up to the top of the cage head to the edge of the cage as far as possible from the blast zone. If he clings to the edge of the cage, go right underneath him.

Attack his legs, ignoring the tail as it doesn’t make a difference whether it is cut off or not.
