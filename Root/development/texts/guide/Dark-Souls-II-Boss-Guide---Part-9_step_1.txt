<h3>Prowling Magus and Congregation</h3> Not quite sure if this is really a “Boss” as we know it but, rules are rules. 

Magus and co are a single Magus enemy, two Priestesses and an assortment of Undead Hollows. The Magus will fire dark magic, the priestesses lightning spells mixed with healing spells for the entire group and the hollows just do their zombie shuffle. The entire collection all contribute to the health pool so one lowly hollow represents a portion of the bosses health.

First, let’s kill the Priestesses. They are probably the biggest threat as their lightning can do annoying damage and no one wants their boss to be healing. They are human sized so backstab if you want/can. With them down we can focus on the Magus, same deal, backstabs work or just rapid poking. Watch out for his dark repulsion attack, when too close he will erupt in a blast of magic sending you flying. Kill him and all that’s left are the Hollows. And that’s it, not exactly Ornstein and Smough but at least you get a Titanite Slab.

If you'd like to, Benhart of Jugo is available to be summoned in the Tent area just after the Doors of Pharros exit. If you want his gear set, this is a good fight to have him survive.
