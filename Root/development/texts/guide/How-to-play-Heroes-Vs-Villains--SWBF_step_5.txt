Players often think that the more kills they have, the higher their score will be. This only somewhat true. Yes, you could go around and kill as many Soldier players as possible to get a high score, but it all depends on how much time per round you have. More often than not, the rounds are over in under two minutes, which simply isn’t enough to gain a high kill count.

This mode is all about damaging the heroes and as such, you gain a lot of points from attacking them. On average you get 150 points for killing a Soldier, however using the Explosive Charge and shooting a Hero, you can gain the same amount of points after only about two seconds of shooting them. 

This is why it’s important to stick with your Hero teammates as they will be the focus of attention, allowing you to shoot the opposing Heroes and gain hundreds of points.
