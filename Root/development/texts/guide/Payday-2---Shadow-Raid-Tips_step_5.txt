Besides the waterfront, the map can be divided into three major areas - the outdoor area, the warehouse, and the top floor. While packages and crowbars can be found outside these areas and near the waterfront, all the valuable loot is in these areas.

In the outside area, there are many shipping containers you can search for loot - the ones you're looking for are the red ones.

To raid the crates in the warehouse, you'll need a crowbar. If there isn't a crowbar against the wall near the entrance to the shed and the zipline, you can find one in the sewers at a blocked passage or in the kitchen (which is in the warehouse). There are often others around, but these two spots are the most consistent spots to find a crowbar in my experience.
