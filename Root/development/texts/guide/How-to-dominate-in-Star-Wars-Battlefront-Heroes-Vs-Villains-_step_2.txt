<h3>Stick with your teammates</h3>

This is perhaps the most important step, though one that a lot of players forget. 

Going against the opposing team alone as a Soldier or Hero will almost always end in you dying. The best strategy is for all Heroes and Soldiers to stick together as it makes it very easy to kill the enemy player who tries to attack. 

Even if your teammates run off in different directions, follow a Hero as they will be the focus of attention and allow you to shoot the enemy while they aren’t focused on you.

<h3>Use the middle section of the map to your advantage</h3>

All of the maps in this mode are designed where the middle section is a large open area with paths on either side leading to the opposite end of the map, usually blocked by walls or terrain. 

Majority of the time when players (either Hero or Soldier) run straight down the middle, they either take damage or die from the opposing team who can easily see them. Unless you know the enemy isn’t aiming their sights down the middle section, it’s best to go around the outskirts and flank them.

If you see the opposing team running down the middle however, it’s a good opportunity to use an explosive weapon, such as the Homing Shot, Bobba Fett’s Rocket or Han Solo’s Lucky Shot as there is little cover for them to hide.
