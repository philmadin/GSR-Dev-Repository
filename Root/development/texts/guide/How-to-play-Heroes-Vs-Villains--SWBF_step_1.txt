<h3>Choose the right loadout</h3>

Having the correct loadout makes all the difference between life and death. If you have enough credits, use the Jetpack, Homing Shot and Explosive Shot. Upgrade them to decrease their refresh time. Each are tactically catered for different scenarios:

Jetpack – Reaching high vantage points and escaping when a Hero or Soldier gets too close.

Homing Shot – Shooting enemies from a great distance to inflict a huge amount of damage. It's best used when a Hero is surrounded by others for the explosion to damage (or kill) the surrounding players for maximum points. 

Explosive Shot – When you have a clear shot of a Hero, using this will significantly increase your laser impact and inflict incredible amounts of damage, giving you more points. This is also great for gaining the upper hand when in a firefight with another player.
