<h3>Skeleton Lords</h3> Don’t worry, these guys aren’t as menacing as the name suggests. The room is occupied by three well dressed Skeletons. One wielding a Roaring Halberd, another has a sort of Bone Staff and a third carrying a Scythe. Don’t kill them all at once. Each individual Lord is responsible for one of three summoned packs of skeletons.

First, let’s kill the Halberd Skeleton, as his summons are regular Skeletons. Knock him down, kill his groupies and that’s that. Next we will kill the Scythe Skeleton. This guy spawns skeletons wearing raggedy armor so they are stronger than the naked ones, but only just. Same deal, kill the Lord, educate his homies and we’re on to the final Lord. This guy, the Staff Lord, summons two Bonewheel Skeletons, remember these guys? Well no worries, they’ve been toned down a bit so kill them asap and you’re all done. The entire fight shares one health pool so Lords and summons are all connected. Everything must die to win.

Creighton of Mirrah is summonable in the cave system the Skeletons live in just before the Boss fog.
