<h3>Dragonslayer Armour</h3>

Ornstein Mark III wields a big fat shield and an enormous axe imbued with Lightning. Despite his appearance the fight follows some easy to read patterns. Dragonslayer’s attacks are more often spectacle than substance.

From the start, Dragonslayer’s shield will remain up unless attacking. He does however attack a lot, leaving himself wide open to hits. The pattern goes something like this: lure out/wait for his attack, dodge it, make sure you’re clear from a follow up, hit him back once or twice, then prepare for the next cycle. This pattern is true of many an enemy or Boss in Dark Souls but here it is quite obvious. Should Dragonslayer appear to be charging an attack, back off and wait until the last moment before rolling away. These blows are capable of dealing severe damage.

Again at the halfway point, the fight escalates, but only slightly. Creatures floating on either side of the bridge you are fighting on will launch brown balls of liquid that cause heavy damage if they connect. If you and Dragonslayer keep moving up and down the bridge as you fight they won’t really be a problem.  Just make sure to dodge his attacks and the fight will be over fairly quickly.
