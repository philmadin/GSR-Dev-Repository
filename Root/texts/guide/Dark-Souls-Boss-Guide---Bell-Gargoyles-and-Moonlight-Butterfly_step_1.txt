Bell Gargoyles

One of the toughest fights for a new player, The Bell Gargoyles, are not only a difficult obstacle, but defeating them is a good barometer for how your character is doing, and how well your character is progressing.

Before we enter the fight, keep in mind that Solaire of Astora and Knight Lautrec of Carim are available to be summoned to help, their summon signs are located near the ladder leading to the fog door.

Now, to the fight. Walk on through and you’ll be treated to a large weaponised Gargoyle flying down to shoo you away. Fighting him one on one is not too complex, in fact, his moves are fairly easily dodged and/or blocked. Simply roll away or resist his Halberd attacks and keep an eye on his fire breath and you’ll be ok. Until the second Gargoyle comes down.

The second one is only at half health however now you have two enemies to deal with. Their pattern will stay fairly similar from here with one gargoyle staying back and breathing fire and the other going in for physical assaults. Your best bet is to pick a target and not stop until that one target is dead. Switching back and forth will draw out the fight and simply overcomplicate it.

Keep a close eye on who is attacking and who is breathing fire, whittle down your chosen enemy and once it is dead, the fight goes back to its original form. Of course, this fight is made much easier with the help of Solaire and Lautrec, however it’s always good to try these fights on your own first, then seek help when you feel too overwhelmed.
