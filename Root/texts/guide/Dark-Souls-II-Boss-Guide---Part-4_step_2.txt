<h3>Lost Sinner</h3> Your first Old One. The Lost Sinner lives in her cell at the bottom of Sinner’s Rise and before we go in, let’s fix something. Her arena is in complete darkness which severely limits your vision but also your lock on range. So, using the Bastille Key, head to either side of the entrance to her arena and light up a torch. Enter each small cell on either side and set fire to the oil trails so that we can light up her lair.

With that done we can fight her properly. Don’t get cocky as The Sinner’s attacks are bizarre and track extremely well. She will hound you most of the time, only backing off to attempt an attack or circle you menacingly. If you try to attack she may simply leap out of the way or, potentially parry you. So, treat this like a duel and don’t waste stamina.

This said, the fight doesn’t change, she will always attack in similar ways. Dodge them if you can, block them if you can’t dodge. Always manage your stamina so as not to have your guard broken and should you choose to bear a shield, make sure it has at least 90% physical damage minimum. 

Lucatiel can also be summoned for this fight, her sign is at the bottom of the elevator you used to reach this floor. In NG+ she will be very useful as midway through the fight, two Pyromancers leap into the fray and begin hurling lethal Firebombs at you. They have low health but are very dangerous so leave Lucatiel to deal with Lost Sinner whilst you round up the strays.
