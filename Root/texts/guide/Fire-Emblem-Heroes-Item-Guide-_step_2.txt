<h3>SHARDS & CRYSTALS:</h3> Shards and Crystals are what you can use to help level up your characters. They come in different colours that power up its specific class, although universal shards and crystals can power any unit. 

Shards power up allies from level 1 to 19, while crystals cover those that’re level 20 and higher. Earn the coloured shards and crystals by playing at the Training Tower, and complete main story quests for your universals.
