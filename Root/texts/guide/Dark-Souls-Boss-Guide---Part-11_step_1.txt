<h3>Sanctuary Guardian</h3> Sanctuary Guardian resides right after the first Bonfire of the DLC. Follow the narrow path and through the gate will be your foe. Sanctuary Guardian is wild and dangerous. He has physical and Lightning attacks of which he makes excessive and great use of. He can stagger players and chew through their health and stamina in seconds. So how do you fight that? 

Well the answer is by waiting. His attacks are aggressive but they are also fairly well telegraphed or take time to reach you giving you those precious micro seconds to leap out of the way. Some attacks - such as when he attempts to leap atop you and misses, or attempts to hurl a wave of water and wind at you - will leave him immobile, leaving ample time to get a strong hit in. Otherwise it’s best to just let him attack you and block/evade as best you can until he attempts something with a recovery time.

His Lightning attacks will expand should they touch the watery floor of the arena. If this happens get out of its way as fast as you can to prevent multiple hits as the electricity spreads.

Pyro’s and Sorcerers will find this fight fairly straight forward with both methods of attack doing strong damage against the beast, despite an apparent resistance to magic. Cutting off his tail will net you the Guardian Tail, which is like a Whip but poisonous. Oh and for the curious, his special Soul does nothing but provide some currency souls. Bummer.
