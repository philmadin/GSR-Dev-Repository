<h3>Crossbreed Priscilla</h3> Priscilla lives in the Painted World of Ariamis and will allow you to come and go as you please, however if you chose to attack her, she will be hostile from then on and, sadly, killing her will be required to leave her world.

Should one attack this young lady, they will find that she vanishes immediately, only to attack with her large scythe that causes severe Bleed damage. Her movements can be tracked by her footprints in the snow or you may simply bump into her. Do enough damage and she will remove her invisibility.

Once visible again Priscilla will use her Scythe whilst randomly blowing a Blizzard at you. Otherwise you should be fine to simply dodge her attacks and attack as per normal. The tricky part is really only whilst she is invisible.

Her tail can be cut off for Priscilla’s Dagger however it is awkward to do and you may need to restart a few times if this be your goal.
