<h3>Blue Smelter Demon</h3> No, that isn’t a typo, at the end of the Iron Passage lies the final boss for Old Iron King, Smelter Demon. You may notice however that he isn’t 100% similar, in fact this one is magic infused, not fire like the one encountered within the Iron Keep.

The fight is essentially the same as previous except for a few things. One, he has the same delaying of his attacks as both Fume Knight and Sir Alonne. He will use this regularly so don’t get complacent with healing. Second, his magic is much more deadly than the fire Smelter Demon causing sever damage with single strikes, if not simply killing you outright. Third, his ability to emit flames on himself and his sword occur much sooner and are accompanied by explosions, just in case you thought you’d get some hits in while he’s busy.

However, treat him with the same caution as before and you’ll be ok.When he plunges his sword into the ground, wait for that delayed burst and when he begins to emit magic from his body, pop some lifegems to counter the effect. However you may need stronger ones due to the increased damage he causes.

At the entrance to the Iron Passage are summon signs, use them without mercy as the area is intended to be taken on with multiple people.
