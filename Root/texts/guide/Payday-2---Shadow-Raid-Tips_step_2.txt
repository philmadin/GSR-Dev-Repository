When you enter the game, you'll want to head around to the left of the warehouse and go down the side. (Don't forget your thermite paste!) Watch out for guards back here, especially in Overkill or Death Wish difficulties. If you're playing the latter, there is almost always a guard patrolling in your path. You may need to climb the ladder of the abandoned warehouse, jump across to the opposite roof, climb onto the higher roof using the air-conditioner unit, and drop off gently onto the nearby shipping container.

Further along the waterfront, you'll see your bag zipline and a doorway to an empty shed. This shed will essentially be your base of operations. It's a good place to drop your body bags unless you want to keep them handy.

Ensuring this area is clear of guards from the start makes the mission a lot easier from this point on.
