<h3>BADGES & HERO FEATHERS:</h3> If you’re really unlucky (like me) and are unable to nab those 5 star characters from the summoning ritual, you can use Badges and Hero Feathers to unlock an ally’s potential. Similar to shards and crystals, badges come in different colours depending on class. Ordinary Badges unlock the potential for allies 3 stars or lower, while Great Badges do the same for 4 stars. 

Badges are available at the training tower, with Great Badges only available from the sixth stratum or higher. Different coloured badges are available, depending on the day. Now you can spend all your time accumulating your badges in order to get your 5 star ally, but you won’t be getting anywhere without Hero Feathers. In order to unlock an ally’s potential, you must meet a specific quota of badges and hero feathers, then you’re rewarded with your buffed up prize. 

By starting a challenge at the arena, you can be on your way to earning your Hero Feathers. Complete a streak and you’re rewarded with a good number of them. You can also earn your feathers by talking to an ally at the home screen displaying hearts, and by sending an ally home. If you get stuck with a few low powered chumps, send them home for a small sum.
