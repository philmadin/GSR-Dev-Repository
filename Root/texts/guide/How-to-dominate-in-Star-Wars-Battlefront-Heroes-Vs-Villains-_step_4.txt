<h3>Stand your ground when fighting a Hero</h3>

A lot of people tend to flee when confronted by a Hero in hopes of surviving, only to die moments later when they chase after you. More than likely you’re going to snuff it when in a close proximity to one (unless you manage to escape using the jetpack) so you might as well pump them full of laser-blasted lead before getting killed.

This tip is especially useful when playing as a Bodyguard since it takes the Heroes a few hits to kill them. 

Don’t worry about your K/D ratio as you can make up for it when playing as a Hero (see step 6 for tips on how to play as a Hero).
