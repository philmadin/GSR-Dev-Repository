<h3>Covetous Demon</h3> This unfortunate blob is easy for some, a problem for others. His attacks, despite his poor fitness, are very good at tracking you and it can be easy to be squished or rolled over or even consumed if care is not taken.

Firstly, see those jars hanging from the ceiling? Well there are hollows inside them that, when shattered, drop down into the arena causing the Demon to abandon you for some lunch. Use throwing knives, firebombs, whatever you wish to knock them down.

As for killing our over fed foe, well, just hit him. He has no special abilities that make it dangerous to attack, just get on his side and hack away, being careful to back away when he is about to roll or flop or devour.
