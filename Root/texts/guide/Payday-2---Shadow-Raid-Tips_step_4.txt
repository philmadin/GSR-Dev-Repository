The thermite paste should be used on the first sewer grate you see coming from the shed - whether that's the one that sometimes appears between that entrance or the warehouse entrance, or the next one along (not the one that faces the riverfront - there's often people watching from the roof, or cameras, so it's not worth it for the shortcut). This will allow you passage between the shed, the warehouse, and just outside the warehouse. Don't use it on the grate nearest the starting point, though - it's unnecessary considering the number of potential entrances to the compound.

If you're in an area such as the warehouse, juggling multiple bags of loot, it may be worth throwing some into the sewer to be returned later (usually to the zipline). Just be aware that if you trigger an alarm, you may not have time in that last 60 seconds before failure to move them to a drop point.
