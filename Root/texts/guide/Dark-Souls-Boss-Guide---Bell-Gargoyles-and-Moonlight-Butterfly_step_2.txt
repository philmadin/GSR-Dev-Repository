Moonlight Butterfly

Whilst this boss is fairly defenceless, it is very awkward. Your arena here is a narrow sliver of bridge with your adversary hogging the skies. For characters that have picked up a bow and some arrows, firebombs or are magic based, this fight will not be as daunting, however if you are simply man/woman with sword and shield, life will be tough. 

So, down floats the pretty little Moonlight Butterfly. It’s attacks are all magic based and can cause severe damage, some being able to outright kill you at this stage in your characters life. A shield with high magic defence is crucial or being able to effectively dodge its attacks. It will attack either by shooting magic darts at you, magic balls that track you, a magic laser that goes from right to left, a magic blast that it releases down on top of you when it changes sides of the bridge and another when it has finished feeding on moss.

As I said, if you have ranged abilities simply wait for a chance and fire away. Don’t get greedy, but you should be fine to simply rain down hell on it with minimal risk. Should you be a melee combatant, defend against its attacks or evade them until it floats down and starts nibbling on the bridge. It’s completely open to attack at this point so hack away. Be careful though, as mentioned there is a magic explosion it releases when it is finished eating. 

The difficulty will come down to how well you can survive its entirely magic attack set given how small of a magic defence you will have at this point of the game. However, should you return to the Undead Asylum and face off against Oscar, Knight of Astora (the knight who gave you your first Estus Flask) you will be able to obtain the Crest Shield. This shield has 80% Magic defence which is extremely high and will make the Moonlight Butterfly’s attacks mere bug bites.
