<h3>Max Level</h3> 

You’ve hit level 30, now what?


<h3>Named/Elite mobs around the New York map:</h3>

Remember those elite mobs with a small group of thugs in tow that I told you not to kill? Now’s the time to go out and hunt them down!

This is for two reasons:

1.They drop Phoenix Credits at max level

2.They drop guaranteed purple gear (albeit with a rather small loot table) that are definite upgrades for a fresh level 30

<h3>Finish the last Story Mission!</h3>

The biggest reason to save this one until max level is because the very first time you do it you’re guaranteed four+ purple drops from the final boss. 

As a fresh level 30 this is a great way to give your stats (and Gearscore) a little boost.

Remember: Gear upgrades are going to be plentiful at first but will drop off as you get more and more of the 145>163>182>204>214>240 level Gear. Use the above two tips to give you a good start on your end-game grind.

<h3>Hard-modes and Incursions!</h3>

Hard/Challenge-mode missions as well as the newly added “Incursion” missions are considered the chunk of PvE end-game in The Division. 

These can range from fast and easy to insanely difficult. Rewards will also vary from Blue/Purple set gear to Phoenix Credits and High-End(Yellow) and gear set (light green) gear!

These can be interesting playing solo but you will get the most enjoyment out of match-making or grouping up with friends.

Make a twink for the Darkzone!

The Darkzone itself is considered a different experience to the core-game.

This is due to the fact that not only is it a PvP-enabled area; it also has its own levelling system.

This bracket is broken down even further and as follows:

Levels 1-14 Base Level
Levels 15-19 Base Level
Levels 20-24 Base Level
Levels 25-29 Base Level
Level 30 Base Level (broken down into Gear Score Brackets)

This means that you can level a character in the main game to level 14, 19, 24 or 29 and basically enter the dark zone and melt faces. This is commonly known as twinking and is quite popular in MMORPGs. 

Once you have your first max level character, levelling a second as a twink shouldn’t take too long at all, and is always a good way to jump into a game and run rampant!
