Before you start the heist, there are a few things you should buy in Pre-planning. The first of these is thermite paste. A useful place for this is right out the front, near where you spawn. You'll use this to open up the sewers in order to more easily transport bags.

The other essential thing you'll need is the bag zipline on the waterfront. This is in the perfect spot for taking bags from the outdoor area and the upper warehouse. It's also near a sewer grate away from the prying eyes of guards, which makes it the best spot to take loot you find in the warehouse.

Feel free to use your other favours on whatever you'd like. Body bags should be your deployable, so you shouldn't need to drop them, but spycams and loot drop off points are worthwhile.
