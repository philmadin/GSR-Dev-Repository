Taurus Demon

This is your first experience of a boss in the wild. Upon entering through the fog gate stop and look to your right. See that ladder? Climb it and take out the Hollows at the top. Notice that the wall is crumbling at the top of the ladder, perfect place for a plunging attack wouldn’t you say?

Jump down and continue across the bridge until the Taurus Demon arrives. Give him a wave if you’d like then rush back towards the ladder asap. Climb it and hopefully the boss hasn’t quite caught up to you. Once he’s at the base of the ladder, jump down and stab him in the head, just like the Asylum Demon. Don’t linger on top of the tower for too long though as the Demon will jump up and fight you there if you dawdle.

Now comes the tricky part. Taurus is quite large and either way the arena quite narrow, his attacks are heavy and have a bigger area of effect than it seems at first. Try to keep your distance at all times and lure him into making a mistake. When he brings his axe down, missing an attack, swoop in and land a few hits then retreat. Should you be backed up on the opposite of the arena try to turn him around and using the same method, attack and retreat until either he’s dead or you run out of room again. You may even be able to make room for another plunging attack.

There are two other methods that can help. One, is bring a friend. This area is high traffic for Summons, but also Invasions. If you feel it’s worth the risk, try gaining your humanity and summoning help from those white Summon Signs lying on the ground.
