<h3>Old Iron King</h3> Despite his size, the Old Iron King is a bit of a pushover. His attacks are brutal but keep a cool head and you’ll be fine.

If there is one reason you will die a lot, it is the arena. It’s smaller than a closet and the lava pool to the immediate right of the door will claim at least half of those deaths. Keep an eye on your surroundings so as not to be knocked to a molten death.

Iron King's attacks compliment his physique, big and crushing attacks intended to turn you to paste. His fire attacks are dangerous due to the confined location of the fight. Should he attempt a fire attack it is best to get out of its way.

Your biggest opportunities are when he does attacks that leave his arms outstretched and/or vulnerable. Point in case, his Fire Kamehameha. This attack has a wind up where he powers up his hand then launches fire in a straight line at you. Dodge to the side and you have a giant opening to show him your feelings. Again, he will do another attack in which he clasps his hands together above his head and smashes down attempting to crush you. Avoid this and you’ll have another giant opening. It’s all about these moments, learning when he’s making a massive attack and avoiding it to retaliate with your own.

He will breath fire regularly in different arcs across the arena. You can dodge through them but it’s tricky so try to learn where his attack will stop based on where it starts, then position yourself in the safe zone. 

Manhunter O’Harrah is available to help with this fight and given her Greatbow she’s a valuable assistant however, she is susceptible to getting knocked/falling off the map so, consider this before hiring her services.
