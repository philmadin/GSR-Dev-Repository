<h3>STAMINA POTIONS, DUELING CRESTS and LIGHT'S BLESSINGS:</h3> Dueling crests, Stamina potions and Light’s Blessings are pretty rare items, mostly gained by completing monthly challenges.

Stamina is an absolute necessity if you're looking to spend extended periods of time playing Fire Emblem: Heroes. Your Stamina is depleted every time you play a match, at varying levels depending on the difficulty. Your Stamina replenishes on it's own in just under five hours, but if you're in the zone, empty a Stamina Potion to continue your trail of dominance.

Dueling Swords are basically your ammo for playing in the Arena. Unfortunately you're only able to carry three swords at a time, which limits your play to three matches. Considering you need a seven win streak to earn your sweet, sweet Hero Feathers, using up a Dueling Crest can keep your momentum going.

Light's Blessings are basically the 'get out of jail free card' of Fire Emblem: Heroes. If you come up against a formidable enemy and your army is wiped out, a Light's Blessing can be used to replenish your health while keeping the damage you've already inflicted on your foe.
