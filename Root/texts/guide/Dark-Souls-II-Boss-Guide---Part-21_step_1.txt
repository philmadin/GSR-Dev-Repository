<h3>Aava, The King’s Pet</h3> Sure that ethereal voice warns you to turn back but, we’ve come so far!

Aava waits at the end of the Bridge, sleeping above the exit. A large, blue and white tiger, Aava is a rough start to your final expansion. For those that immediately enter her domain, i’d urge you to attempt fighting Aava at least once. The death you will get should teach you not to go back. Instead, you need to venture through the level to find the Eye of the Priestess. Only with this item will Aava become visible to you.

Aava possesses both physical and magical attacks. Her physical attacks are with her paws and have a bizarre cone of range. Should she sweep her arms across, the actual damage range of her attack is much further out than it would appear. So, for this reason, always dodge in a way that puts you closer to her and goes in the opposite direction to her swipe. Her move set is fairly similar to what you’d expect a large cat to perform in real life. Lots of pawing and claws.

For her magic, the only one that will directly seek you out is her unique Homing Soul Crystals. At times Aava will run a good distance away and turn to face you, roar, and form five crystals above her head. These will do concerning damage and knock you down should they hit, so, from the moment she runs away, get to one side of the bridge. As the fifth Crystal appears begin sprinting directly across to the other side. This should cause each Crystal to completely miss you.

Her other magic attacks include detonating a blast should you stand too close for too long. The other attack being Aava raising her paw in the air before slamming it down causing ice spikes to erupt from the ground. 

Steelheart Ellie and Masterless Glencour are happy to help tame the beast. Their signs are just outside the fog gate for Ellie and way back at the Bonfire for Glencour.
