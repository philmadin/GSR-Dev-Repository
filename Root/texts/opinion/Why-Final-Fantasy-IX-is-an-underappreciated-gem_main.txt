In every long-running game franchise, there always appears to be an underappreciated gem. We’re talking about the kind of game that follows on from the big hitmakers in that particular franchise. Due to this unfortunate fate, they are condemned to living in the shadow of the hitmaker(s) in question. For Square-Enix’s (Squaresoft at the time) Final Fantasy IX, this was seemingly the case. Final Fantasy VII and VIII were huge releases, having helped the JRPG genre become big in the West, but FFIX was the game that tagged along near the end of the PS1’s life in 2000. It is criminal how overlooked this title was and still is next to other FFs.<br />
<br />
The game differed from its previous two PS1 predecessors in many respects. Gone were the cyberpunk, semi-futuristic elements of VII and VIII – in their place was a traditional medieval fantasy world similar to the setting of earlier FF titles. Considering this, it’s no secret that Final Fantasy IX is a celebration of the franchise up to that point, making sure to include references to past games. Whether that be lead protagonist Zidane’s claim that he remembered “a guy with spiky hair” who wielded a Buster Sword-esque weapon in the city of Lindblum or the Eidolon Ramuh’s tale about Josef who died trying to save the young rebels of Final Fantasy II, the game acts as warm nostalgia for the dedicated FF player. Even the childlike character models take us back to the NES/SNES games. But of course, the game’s respect and acknowledgement of its predecessors is just the tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />
A huge part of the game’s appeal is due to its ragtag bunch of endearing characters. While the FFs up to this point gave us angsty heroes such as Cloud, Squall and Terra, FFIX gave us the lovable young womaniser and thief, Zidane Tribal, the naive innocent black mage, Vivi and the incompetent and clownish bodyguard of Princess Garnet, Adelbert Steiner. The characters were both unique and charming in their own ways and, at the same time, defied the archetypes on which their roles are usually associated with. For example, rather than being a dull NPC who needed saving (i.e. Sara from FF1), we were given a relatable, three-dimensional princess who was a competent key player in the party, going by the very unladylike alias of ‘Dagger’.<br />
<br />
When character archetypes were being turned on their head, so were the archetypes belonging to typical locations in fantasy fiction. While giving us the same warm, colourful medieval-esque setpieces of the original FFs, Square introduced the intriguing concept of airships running on Mist and Black Mages being used as manufactured weapons of war. The reintroduction of the Moogles also added some charm and uniqueness to the game’s world. Some of the most cute and humorous moments come from the game’s Mognet function, where you read letters from the game’s Moogles and participate in side-quests.<br />
<br />
Side-quests aside, the battle system was a nice change from its older PS1 brothers. It wasn’t as complex as that of VII and VIII, but that didn’t matter as it was fun. The idea of characters coming with their own prefixed job roles was reminiscent of V and VI. A cool feature was how certain characters could combine their strengths. For example, Vivi could use his magic to allow Steiner to use elemental sword attacks. More impressive was that characters each had their own ‘Trance’ state, where they could access amplified versions of their usual abilities, causing more damage for their opponents. Again, the battle system took us back to a simpler time in JRPGs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having been around for sixteen years, Final Fantasy IX is an old game, but still a true classic. While it may not have had the impact on JRPGs that VII and VIII had, it’s still worthy of being up there with the best FFs. Combine a charming medieval fantasy world, a simple but fun battle system, great soundtrack and a cast of lovable characters and you’ve got yourself a recipe for JRPG success. This game has all of that in spades and a worthy purchase for veterans and newbies alike when it comes to Steam this year.<br />
