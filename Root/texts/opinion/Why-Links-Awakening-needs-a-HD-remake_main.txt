2016 will be an exciting time for fans of The Legend of Zelda. Not only will we finally play Zelda Wii U, but Nintendo is keeping us going until then with a Twilight Princess HD rerelease, pencilled in for March 2016. <br />
<br />
Surely one of the darkest yet strangest games in the series, it is for this reason that Twilight Princess sticks out among them. The excitement of this scheduled HD update makes us consider other possibilities for future Zelda rereleases. One of them should be the GameBoy’s Link’s Awakening.<br />
<br />
And why not? This classic deserves an update since it was the first Zelda to try something new story-wise. For the first time, there was no Ganon, no Triforce, no Hyrule. Hell, there wasn’t even a princess called Zelda. <br />
<br />
Instead, the game revolved entirely around Link, as he gets shipwrecked on a mysterious island called Koholint. Upon waking, he must quest to awaken its divine guardian, the Wind Fish, in order to return home. <br />
<br />
The twist is that the island is not all that it seems and the more the player finds out about Koholint, the more it turns the meaning of the game upside down and changes your perception of it. Before Link’s Awakening, Zelda had never even attempted stories or themes as profound as what is in this instalment.<br />
<br />
It’s no secret that modern systems like the Nintendo 3DS could do justice to the island’s zany atmosphere. The original Game Boy release (and its colour 'DX' version pictured) pulled it off impressively with relatively basic 8-bit technology. <br />
<br />
A touch of the 3DS magic would give Koholint the modern spark it needs, bringing its strangeness to life for a modern audience. <br />
<br />
LA featured some of the wackiest and surreal characters in Zelda history, from a mushroom-obsessed man-child father (who even turns into a raccoon at one point), an anthropomorphic crocodile who is obsessed with bananas and the DX version of the game even throws in a mouse photographer. <br />
<br />
Amongst an island where telephone booths exist incongruously in its otherwise technologically underdeveloped environment and where Mario creatures such as Chain Chomps, Goombas and Piranha Plants reside; the game is strangely inconsistent and yet, its inconsistency is what drives its weird and fascinating quality.<br />
<br />
Such fascinating weirdness makes Koholint a place well worth a HD revisitation, to see how revolutions in 3D graphics can bring this world to life for the modern generation.<br />
<br />
And as far as gameplay goes, the game is as solid as any Zelda that came before or after. It proved that the level design on a technologically limited could contest with the console Zeldas. <br />
<br />
Puzzle-solving was as fun and engaging as ever and the bosses memorable – who could forget throwing a genie bottle against the walls with your power bracelets, or the giant liquid blob that you had to shake off the ceiling by using your Pegasus boots against the walls? <br />
<br />
The battles are seldom frustrating and a ton of fun. For this to be remade in glorious 3D would be a treat for those who have played it and those unfamiliar with it.<br />
<br />
Because that is what Link’s Awakening is, it’s a treat to play and truly deserves a remake for the modern generation. Similar to how A Link Between Worlds was like a tribute to ALttP, a remake of LA would be the perfect tribute to the game’s legacy. <br />
<br />
So, come on, Nintendo - how about giving Link's Awakening some HD love?
