After paving its way past development, Valhalla Studios has finally released their debut title Devil’s Third; which was originally boycotted by the now-defunct publisher THQ back in 2009.<br />
<br />
Devil’s Third was designed by one of the lead masterminds behind the Dead or Alive and Ninja Gaiden series, Tomonobu Itagaki. As credible as it sounds, a six-year wait can only be justified by quality.<br />
<br />
Initially planned to release for the PS3, Xbox 360 and PC; Nintendo shocked everyone at E3 2014 by announcing its newfound exclusivity on Wii U. Now that it’s finally here, fans only want to know one thing: has this controversial title been worth the wait?<br />
