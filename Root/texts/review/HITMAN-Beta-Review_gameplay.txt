Hitman has never felt better. The controls and coordination of actions performed in the game is a major upgrade compared to that of Hitman: Absolution. From every sly movement, distraction and snappy combat, I feel like the reigns have a tighter grip this time round. <br />
<br />
The accuracy of taking cover, scaling, dragging bodies and shooting is the type of improvement that fans were longing all this time. It’s as though the directors were inspired by fan-based feedback to create a fan-feel game.<br />
<br />
All that taken into consideration, there were still a few AI issues with shooting. It would be nice to shoot an AI in the abdomen and see them roll on the ground for a while or crawling away in pain. But nope, you can shoot them two to three times and still watch them flee as though they weren’t shot at all. <br />
<br />
It’s like “Hey George BANG* BANG* BANG*”, “Oh thanks for the free belly rub Agent 47”…seriously?<br />
<br />
Although that’s not the best example of the game’s faults, the least they could have done is implemented shooting through walls again; you’d think, wouldn’t you? Nope.
