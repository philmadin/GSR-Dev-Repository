The voice acting in Just Cause 2 was done by non-Asian people trying to sound like Asian people, and it came off somewhat racist. This infamous voice acting was somewhat addressed in Just Cause 3, with most of the accents in the game being much better - even when it’s a non-specific blend of Spanish and Italian.<br />

The soundtrack has some nice moments, but is otherwise as mediocre as game soundtracks get. The sound effects accommodate all the destruction well, and are quite believable considering the procedural physics in the game. The audio in Just Cause 3 is everything it needs to be, but nothing impressive.
