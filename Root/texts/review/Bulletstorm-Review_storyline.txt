Bulletstorm is set in the 26th century and introduces protagonist Grayson Hunt and his special black ops team as they explore the now mutant-infested once populated resort destination named Stygia.<br />
After being set up by their General whilst on one of the teams missions, they must fight their way through the planet Stygia to get revenge on their manipulative leader.<br />

I found the story wasn’t very inspiring though it was solid and entertaining enough to have me push through to the end. But of course the combat was the focus of Bulletstorm and the developers definitely aced that aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
I think all in all the writers delivered what was expected; an eventful, action-packed story that was fairly interesting and had enough twists to keep you playing for a good few hours.<br />
