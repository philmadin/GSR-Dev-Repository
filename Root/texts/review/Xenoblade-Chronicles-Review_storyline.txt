The story of the game centres around Shulk, a young engineer who inherits a mysterious sword called the Monado. This blade is said to be the ultimate bane against the Mechon; robots who are invading the realm of the Homs (humans, basically).<br />
<br />
And what a realm it is - instead of a traditional continent, Xenoblade Chronicles is set upon the corpses of two gods; the Bionis and Mechonis. These monolithic bodies are locked eternally in combat, with their blades thrust forward and their dead gazes locked forever; it’s not as gory as it sounds. <br />
<br />
The Bionis is an ‘organic’ god, with his rocky organism covered in forests, canyons and oceans – whilst his foe is purely mechanical, with robotic cities littering his surface.<br />
<br />
Truly, this is one of the greatest worlds ever crafted in a videogame – and the plot is similarly detailed, with many twists and turns that is typical of the JRPG genre.<br />
