The guns sound powerful and realistic enough, while the grunts from enemies sound deep and aggressive. <br />
<br />
The “F” bomb may have been a tad overused and it showed some very immature humour, but the voices used for dialogue complemented each character in a way that suits this game perfectly. <br />
<br />
The music that was playing during almost all of the bosses was dramatic and engaging, but I personally think the soundtrack for most of the game could perhaps have had a little more put into it.<br />
