After booting up your HacknetOS, you receive an email from “Bit”, he contacts you to see if you are trustworthy and any sort of good hacker. He needs you because he is dead. <br />
<br />
The email expresses that he has been murdered, and the murderers have their hands on something that could destroy everything hacktivists have been working for. It is up to you to find and enter the hacking community and follow the leads to find Bits killers and destroy their programs.
