Time travel is the fundamental gameplay mechanic that allows players to essentially rewind time in order to make different choices or to solve certain puzzles. It is a cool gimmick that adds hours of replay value. <br />
<br />
This interesting feature allows the player to have fun in conversations and play out a few scenarios before deciding which one to go with. This also makes every choice carry more weight as the game blatantly questions whether it is the right thing to do or not during key moments in the story. <br />
<br />
This feature is supported by free mobility throughout most environments as well as a dialogue wheel similar to Dragon Age and Mass Effect. The ability to walk through different areas and simply listen to Max comment on certain people or items deliver a level of finesse that shows that this really is a living breathing world.<br />
