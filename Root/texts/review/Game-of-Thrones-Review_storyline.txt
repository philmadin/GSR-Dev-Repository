The main plot follows five unique characters from the northern House of Forrester. The ability to play as members of different genders and social classes across the realm add a robust texture to the game. <br />
<br />
The primary focus is to save House Forrester from complete destruction. This requires secretive political maneuvering, brutal violence and general Game Of Thrones badassery.  <br />
<br />
The problem here is that despite having a multitude of different situations/characters to work with, there are very few choices which work in favour of the player. The shock value of morally good characters dying and continual backstabbing occurrences is definitely a part of the allure of GOT; but does not necessarily translate into a compelling gaming experience. <br />

What works for the television series does not exactly work in a video game format and the lack of respite in regard to player choices can be frustrating.
