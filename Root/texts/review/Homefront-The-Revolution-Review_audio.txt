Regularly throughout the game I couldn’t hear what was being said. Music would often overlay conversation and required me to alter the settings to hear the dialogue. Then, the music would be too quiet and I would miss narrative cues because the soundtrack was set low.

Weapon sounds however are fairly meaty yet sometimes don’t occur when triggered by A.I or in scripted moments. Dialogue, when audible, swings from generic to quirky. Sometimes a character continues talking as they walk away, assuming you are right behind them.
