Following in the footsteps of one of the greatest games of all time can’t be an easy task.<br />
<br />
Although not as successful as the epic Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time; The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask gained a rather dedicated following, with many proclaiming it as a superior offering. <br />
<br />
Regardless of the aforementioned, it’s taken 15 years for a remake to emerge - The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask 3D, which has finally graced Nintendo’s stereoscopic handheld. <br />
<br />
Has time dulled this title’s design genius? I’m pretty sure you know the answer to that. Much like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D proved in 2013, Majora’s Mask is a masterpiece in design, with the game feeling just as fresh in 2015 as it did in 2000.<br />
