An upgradeable arsenal of distraction and attack tools, a grappling hook, infinite darts, and two satisfying abilities (as well as one mediocre one) allow the player to play however they want. Each level gives the player a choice of ninja to play as (each with their own effects on the play style), and which tools to take in.<br />

Bodies can be hidden in vents or tossed off roofs. Guards can be killed, knocked out, terrified by the sight of bodies hanging from lamp-posts, or left completely unaware of the ninja's presence. A limited combat system provides a valuable few seconds to escape if caught. Every action gives the player "honour" points to encourage creative kills and discourage sloppy stealth, although the penalties are insufficient and escaping from alerted guards is too easy.<br />

Finally, three unassuming collectibles, three gameplay achievements, and three medals for reaching certain scores provide additional challenges in each already infinitely replayable level.
