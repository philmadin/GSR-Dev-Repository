Random battles are a thing of the past, with all enemies visible on-screen. Their level can always be seen, and they’ll usually ignore you until combat is initiated. The fighting itself is much like an MMO. <br />
<br />
Your main character attacks automatically, but special moves can be selected on the bottom of the screen. After using them, they have a brief ‘cool down’ before they can be used again. <br />
<br />
Your two partners can take care of themselves (though you can order them, if you wish), and there are zero items to be used – with your squad healing after every battle. Even dying is handled more elegantly<br />
<br />
The world is littered with ‘landmarks’ that can be discovered, and act as warp points. Whenever you get knocked out by a tough foe, you simply transport back to the nearest one, with all of your items and experience intact. <br />
<br />
It’s a wonderful system, and one that encourages exploration without fear of losing progress.This is an absolutely huge game, and there’s simply not enough article space to cover it all. <br />
<br />
Aside from the main story, there are hundreds of quests to be completed for an innumerable amount of NPCs (each of whom have their own daily schedule). There are also gems that are awarded to enhance equipment; a diary that documents the budding relationships of the countless people you meet; special events that strengthen the bonds of your party, and even an entire town to rebuild!<br />
