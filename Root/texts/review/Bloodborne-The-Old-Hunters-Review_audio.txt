Saving that grand or melodious score for the boss fights is something of a staple for both Bloodborne and Dark Souls.

The use of not so much terror and immediate fear, but a constant unease and awe, is no more evident than areas like the Research Hall, a labyrinth filled with the failed attempts at communicating with the Great Ones. The screams of patients, crazed, afraid, even a few speaking of regret are so eerie and compelling that I regularly forgot the danger surrounding me, resulting in more than a few deaths.<br />
