As you may be aware, this last plot point forms the stress-inducing core of the game. After reclaiming his Ocarina, Link learns that he can teleport back to the dawn of the first day after a 72-hour period – Groundhog Day style. <br />
<br />
This time-travelling mechanic is where the game’s magic happens, as Link experiences the same events repeatedly, and he must use this power of foresight to his advantage. People go about their lives as the days go by, and solving their woes will reward Link with essential items that will help him get closer to his goal – the most important of these being masks.<br />

Forming the second pillar of Majora’s foundations, these magical assortments of face-wear imbue our elven lad with special abilities, including the metamorphoses into a Deku, Goron and Zora.<br />

Of course, being a remake has also enabled Nintendo to make improvements from the original. The Bomber’s Notebook has been revamped, and the schedules of NPCs are now easier to look up. The Gossip Stone hint system returns, and both a new fishing pod and a revamped boss have been added.<br />
