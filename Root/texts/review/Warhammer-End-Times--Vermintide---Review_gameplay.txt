The gameplay is very reminiscent of the Left 4 Dead style, as you shoot, smash and scurry your way through each dark and gloomy landscape, using weapons you unlock at the end of each level. Each class has various close combat and ranged weapons at their disposal which, when combined with the randomly spawning enemies, makes for a different experience every time you play. Each level has five different difficulty settings, which are not to be taken lightly, as players will find very quickly that failing to work together will spell failure even on the easier settings. The combat system itself is very strong, with an effective block mechanic and each attack that finds its target providing just the right amount of satisfaction for the player. Despite being a tad ‘hack and slashy’ and perhaps repetitive at times, the variety of different enemies and the emphasis of sticking together as a team will keep players engrossed for hours at a time.
