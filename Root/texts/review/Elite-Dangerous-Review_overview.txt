Simulation games were introduced sometime around the 1980s, and one of the first was the 1984 space simulator, Elite. A 3D wireframe game where you could trade, mine, pirate or join the military, the space sandbox allowed players to choose their own path.<br />

Carrying on a thirty year legacy comes Elite’s fourth instalment; Elite Dangerous.
