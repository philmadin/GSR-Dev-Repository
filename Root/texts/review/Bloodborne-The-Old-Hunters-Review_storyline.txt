As ever, FromSoftware have brought us an intriguing and illuminating plot that grants us a greater insight into The Hunt and its Hunters. After defeating Vicar Amelia players gain access to The Hunter's Nightmare, a realm reserved for those Hunters that have been consumed by a lust for blood and were some of the first to take part in The Hunt itself. What follows is a journey to uncover mysteries held hidden deep within the nightmare.<br />

Traversing this DLC felt a lot more coherent than most FromSoftware titles recently. A sense of understanding was present even from early on. Perhaps compared with the base game the story is a little less complex, however it definitely felt that, through item descriptions, observing your surroundings, small cutscenes and bosses themselves, the world made just a little more sense overall.<br />
