Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney is a text-heavy visual novel. With the exception of the first one, the cases all have the same basic structure. You’ll be introduced to the case through a short cutscene, before meeting the client you’ll be defending, and then heading out into the field. <br />
<br />
You are required to pick up clues throughout the investigation via examining various locations as well as talking with potential witnesses and the police. These clues will be then used in the courtroom to contradict testimonies and hunt down the true killer. <br />
