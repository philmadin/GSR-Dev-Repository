Deep in the boundless depths of the ocean lies PATHOS-2, an underwater research facility in a state of disrepair. After a comet destroyed all civilisation in the year 2103, the facility now stands (or sinks…) as humanities last refuge. Simon Jarret (the main protagonist) wakes in this horror after being preserved for nearly 100 years during a blackout brain scan in 2015. <br />
<br />
While navigating the facility, Simon encounters various robots that believe themselves to be human. From these encounters, Simon begins to question everything as the truth of his fate and those of PATHOS-2 sinks in.<br />
<br />
Simon’s uncertainty about where he is and his search for answers drives the considerably tense story. Most of it has to be pieced together from items found since there are no humans left to question. <br />
<br />
The only interaction Simon has is with the robots, which will force the player into a fascinating moral dilemma. These decisions raise important philosophical questions and make Soma a more intense and engaging game.<br />
