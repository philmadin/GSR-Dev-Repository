The cast of Life Is Strange predominantly provide memorable performances that deliver the perfect amount of realism in certain cinematic moments. The most noteworthy performance is by Ashley Burch who has subsequently received a Golden Joystick award for her portrayal of Chloe Price. <br />

The rest of the cast are commendable besides some of the silly teenage lingo that they often have to relay. Its bearable for the most part but "are you cereal?" is seriously eye rolling. <br />

The game also includes a number of underground indie songs that fit perfectly with the flow and mood of Max's personality.<br />
