Overall, there are very few faults to this game and I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. Where it lacks in game length and depth of story it makes up for in it being under half the price of The New Order. <br />
<br />
I would recommend this game to those looking for a relatively inexpensive and fun shooter or those that have played The New Order and want more. To those that wouldn’t mind spending a few extra dollars, however, The New Order provides a proper sized game length and a far better plotline. The Old Blood, in my eyes, is more of an expansion to that of its predecessor. <br />

Despite generally avoiding FPS’s, I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. One might say I did Nazi this coming, hah, I’ll leave now. <br />
