The game lets you experiment with almost every element you could want from a tycoon/business simulation game, so the prison truly feels like your own creation.<br />

An amazing second gameplay mode, Escape Mode, allows you to test your prison or others in the role of a prisoner, but broken or missing features bring this down. Also, escaping from prisons in Escape Mode is either too easy or an annoying grind, with no goals and no real point to the crew system.
