Gameplay is – to put simply – fantastic. For the first time, the series has gone open-world, with Afghanistan and Africa ripe for exploring. This structure allows for far more freedom in infiltrating bases, which change dynamically depending on the time of day. Big Boss can be accompanied by a ‘buddy’, who provides support on the field. These include D-Horse, D-Dog (my favourite), the sniper Quiet and the bipedal bot named D-Walker. <br />
<br />
Much like Peace Walker, base building is a major focus here. Your Mother Base must be expanded, which can add new functions like R&D (for new weapons and equipment), Intel, and Medicine. The Fulton system also returns, which are balloons that can be attached to enemies for recruitment – and this is vital for success. Containers, vehicles, weapons, and even animals can be taken too, which all add to the value of your army.<br />
<br />
Also present is a heavy online component called FOB, which has seen some negative reactions due to how invasive it is in the single-player. Other players can invade your base, and steal your resources, and it’s a major pain to defend yourself constantly. Disconnecting online actually punishes you, as GMP (money) is drastically reduced, and downloading day-one DLC (like I did) makes the game unable to start without an internet connection. Rotten move, Konami, rotten move.<br />
