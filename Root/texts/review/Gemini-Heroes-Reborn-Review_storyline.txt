Gemini starts with the boy-and-girl-explore-abandoned-restricted-area cliché, used as an uninspired tutorial. Throughout the story, which is set in two different years which the player can hop between, these clichés continue to play a large part. However, it remains compelling thanks to its' Heroes-esque mystery, especially when the main character from the other tie-in game shows up.<br />

In the developer's defence, Gemini was penned by writers of the Heroes Reborn TV show, who are likely inexperienced in interactive storytelling.
