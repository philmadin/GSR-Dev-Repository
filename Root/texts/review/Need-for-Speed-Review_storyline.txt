Taking place on the streets of Ventura Bay, a city modelled after Los Angeles, is the clunky story of Need for Speed. The unnamed character joins a ragtag group of street racers wanting to be noticed by their idols. Through various races and challenges, the player has to prove that he can beat the best.<br />

While Need for Speed  is not a story-driven game, there should be more for players to invest in. The goofy acting during the live action sequences makes the game feel awkward. These scenes often fail at delivering a cohesive plot as they are also short. By the end of the game, the player cares more about their car then what has happened.
