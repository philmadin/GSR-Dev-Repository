Cute and effective graphics, a massive amount of control over details with many ways to experiment, a well-balanced system, and a good interface make Prison Architect a joy to play.<br />
<br />
But many essential features are missing, such as a better way of dealing with bodies, more personal control over what the staff are doing, and a better wiring system for security devices.<br />
<br />
Prison Architect is a well-defined, well-rounded simulation missing just a few features and lacking in the audio department, but with plenty of fun to be had experimenting.
