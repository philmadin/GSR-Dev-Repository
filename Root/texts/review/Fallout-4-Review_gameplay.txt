The refinement of the gameplay in Fallout 4 in comparison to previous releases has been long awaited. It is obvious that the gunplay has been heavily influenced by games such as Wolfenstein, resulting is a smoother and more exhilarating combat experience. <br />
<br />
This streamlining takes the game to a whole new level as combat is now something to look forward to, as the previously clunky combat had been a downfall in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. As well as this, the tweaking to the V.A.T.S. to only slow down combat has also aided in this combat makeover. <br />
<br />
There is no drought of enemies to enable you to experience this new combat system, with the number and variety of enemies in the game being vast. Ranging from the smallest of radroaches - to monstrous deathclaws - every battle is memorable. <br />
<br />
A new dynamic in this Bethesda release is that enemies no longer dramatically scale up to your level. For example, if you travel back to an area first encountered at the beginning of your journey they will retain the same amount of difficulty. Because of this reason it is unwise to venture to distant areas of the game early on as the chance of survival is slim.<br />
<br />
As expected there is also a wide array of companions which you can unlock and request to accompany you on your journey through the Boston ruins.<br />
<br />
New crafting and settlement systems are yet another part of the game which will soak up hours upon hours of the player’s time. They will no longer have to be guilty of their hoarding tendencies, with all junk in the game now able to be used in weapon and armour modification, and for use in the settlement workshop. <br />
<br />
Clearly heavily influenced by games such as Minecraft and The Sims, the new optional settlement creation system is huge and enthralling as players are invited to build their own hustling and bustling settlements. <br />
<br />
The manner which stats and perks have been managed adds to the delight of the game. The wide diversity of options will find players staring at their screens unable to decide on which ones to pick. With the removal of a level cap and no end to the game after completion of the main storyline, the sky is the limit in regards to character progression.<br />
<br />
Although the gameplay doesn’t leave a lot to wish for, the game has its fair share of bugs which unfortunately has become expected of Bethesda games.<br />
