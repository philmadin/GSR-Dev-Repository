Characters are not just limited to humans. Dinosaurs can be utilized once unlocked, to progress to new areas. Smashing rocks as a Stegosaurus or roaring as the T-Rex is never a dull experience. Once a level is completed, it is open for exploring with all characters. <br />

Both Jurassic Park and Jurassic World received more attention than their other films counterparts. With longer levels and extensive worlds, it is disappointing that the other films were not as fleshed out.<br />

For those with a soft spot, LEGO Jurassic World hits all the right buttons. Tackling puzzles as your favourite character is a joy in the detailed set pieces. What it lacks in innovation, it makes up with an amusing variety in gameplay and story. It is a simple and light-hearted game for all ages.
