With minimal music within the game, the audio focus is all based on action. The game focuses on total immersion, trying to put the player in the cockpit, flying their own ship, and it has been done extremely well. However, I was hoping to hear what music Frontier Developments would play as you fly through the galaxy.<br />

There are times where some sounds are just deafening compared to the others. Speeding up, you can barely hear anything, whereas if you crash full speed into a wall, the sound is pretty quiet in comparison, making audio fairly inconsistent.
