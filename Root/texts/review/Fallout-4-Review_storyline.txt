Unlike previous games in the series, players are able to briefly experience the world prior to nuclear fallout, and the privilege to do so in this game was exciting. <br />
<br />
However, following a traumatising event you are promptly thrust out of Vault 111 and into the wasteland with a whole lot of unanswered questions. As the vault wanderer, you are on a trip to reclaim the life that has been stolen from you.<br />
<br />
As expected, along your search for answers you will encounter new friends and make enemies throughout the wasteland. The immaculate characterisation of NPCs in the game just adds to the believability of this post-nuclear world.<br />
<br />
Although the primary storyline is engrossing, the well-written side quests is where the game really shines. This only comes as a result of the immense freedom which the game permits. This is exemplified in the way the main narrative seemingly blends in amongst the riveting and intersecting storylines throughout the wasteland. <br />
<br />
During the journey, there are momentous decisions for the vault wanderer which shapes the game’s main story arc and will affect their reputation with key figures in the Commonwealth. It’s going to take players multiple playthroughs to experience all of the possible pathways. <br />
<br />
In comparison to Fallout 3, the way in which Bethesda tells its story has matured greatly. Albeit a change from previous releases, the implementation of fully voiced protagonists provides another immersing storytelling medium.<br />
