Set in the remote glacial mountains of Canada, eight friends become trapped when a getaway trip goes wrong. Twin sisters, Hannah and Beth, are presumed missing after running into the woods from an embarrassing prank. One year later, they are reinvited back to Blackwood Pines, to mark the anniversary of that tragic night. <br />
<br />
As the night unfolds, events quickly turn sinister, as each person determines their survival through choices. At face value, Until Dawn appears to overuse those typical horror movie cliché’s for a cheap joke or jump-scare. However, the game progressively adds layers to the story if the player wishes to find them.<br />
