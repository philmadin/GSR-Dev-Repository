Leo himself is fairly chatty. His intermissions between certain levels allow him to, as mentioned, describe his journey so far and his thoughts on where he may go. During the level, stumbling upon and solving puzzles will cause him to speak, noting his suspicion of a trap nearby, how complex something may seem, or patting himself on the...er, back, for progressing.<br />

The soundtrack isn’t forceful, simply filling the background space as it needs to whilst providing an enjoyable ambience to your travels.
