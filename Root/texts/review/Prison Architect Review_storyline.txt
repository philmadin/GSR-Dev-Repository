The campaign mode tells the story of various prisoners and their prison journeys. It uses the real life “punishment or rehabilitation” arguments about prisons to further the story and show the player different ways to run a prison. <br />

The plot is nothing special, but it’s a nice touch considering that no story was necessary. The use of the campaign as a tutorial doesn’t feel as forced as it is, and it achieves what it set out to do.
