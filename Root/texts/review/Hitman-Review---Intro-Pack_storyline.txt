Following his escape from the asylum in Romania (Hitman: Codename 47, 2000), 47 is noticed by the ICA for his unique skills. After first meeting his Handler Diana Burnwood, he is placed under a series of tests to prepare him for ICA targets; which are enveloped in the Prologue. The Prologue contains two missions that are more-so training lessons for players to develop their skills with the game, and to prepare for the Paris mission.<br />
<br />
In the prime of his career, Agent 47 travels the world assassinating high profile targets for the ICA. Present day, 47 is in Paris assigned to assassinate two targets that are ringleaders of a spy organisation known as IAGO. These targets are major players in the fashion industry and are hosting an illustrious fashion show in the heart of Paris. Although this is a highly populated event, 47 never dusts before a challenge. <br />
