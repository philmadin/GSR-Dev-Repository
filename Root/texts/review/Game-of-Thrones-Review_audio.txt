The voice acting present in Game of Thrones is one of its most redeeming qualities. Several of the actors from the television show reprise their roles and produce notable performances that will surely delight avid fans. <br />

Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) is particularly radiant and highlights why fans of Destiny were so disappointed when it is clearly shown here that he is capable of excellent voice work. Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Lena Headey (Cersei), Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), Iwan Rheon (Ramsay) and Natalie Dormer (Margaery) all contribute to this title and embody their characters to an impressive degree. <br />
