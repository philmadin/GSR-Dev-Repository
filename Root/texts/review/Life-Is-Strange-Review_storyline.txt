This game follows the journey of Max Caulfield, an intelligent yet terribly introverted photography student who has returned to her home town in order to attend the prestigious Blackwell Academy. Oh yes, and she can also rewind time. <br />
<br />
The story revolves around the relationship between Max and her estranged childhood friend Chloe Price. Together these two wonderfully complex characters must reignite their friendship and delve into a much deeper, darker truth that is lurking beneath the surface of the quiet town Arcadia bay. <br />
<br />
Dontnod tug at the heartstrings of its players by approaching delicate subjects such as depression, suicide and assault with an impressive amount of maturity. It is a remarkable emotional roller coaster that encapsulates how modern storytelling can be done. <br />
