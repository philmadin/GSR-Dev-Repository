The environments, which seem like the lovechild of Mirror's Edge and Portal 2, are absolutely stunning. The lighting seems to dance around some spaces in a beautiful display that begs the player to ignore all of Gemini's imperfections. <br />

The visual effects of Cassandra's powers work well and look good, but the same cannot be said for those of the boss battles. The first major encounter is visually reminiscent of a children's game of 2006; subsequent battles fail to raise the bar.<br />

This game is gorgeous thanks to its' environments, lighting, minimalistic fonts and HUD, and effects. The few disappointing visuals are quickly dismissed once the player is captured by the beauty of Gemini's slow motion gameplay.
