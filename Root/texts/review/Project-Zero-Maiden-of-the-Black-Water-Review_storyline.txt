Project Zero is set within the chilling Mount Hikami, an area cursed with the spirits of the damned. Hikami – which is based on Japan’s real-world Aokigahara suicide forest – has a long and unsavory history regarding the Shrine Maidens, women who were sacrificial lambs for a mysterious cult that tried desperately to keep an ancient evil at bay.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to the modern day, and gamers take the role of three different protagonists. Yuuri Kozukata is a girl who can see the ‘shadow realm’ (basically, the spirit world), Ren Hojo is a writer who is plagued the nightmares of the Shrine Maidens, and Miu Hinasaki is a woman who takes over the ghost busting trade from her mother Miku Hinasaki – a hero from previous games.<br />
<br />
Events lead all three of them to Hikami, and each of their stories intersects in order to make sense of the horrifying events that plague the mountain.<br />
