Red Goddess: Inner World unfortunately falls prey to ‘lazy development’ syndrome. Although a decent effort for an indie game; every aspect of the game feels like it was developed hastily in the company lunch room and optimised for a ‘90s game console. <br />
<br />
This combined with its poorly designed ‘emotive’ and crashtastic experience makes this the type of game you might buy to keep your child entertained, while you move on to something more finished. <br />
<br />
It is possible that most of these issues are purely on the PC code version, and for the sake of the game I hope this is the case.
