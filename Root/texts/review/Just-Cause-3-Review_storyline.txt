The Just Cause franchise has always been criticised for its plots and poor storytelling only because Avalanche believes that gameplay is paramount. It's no surprise to find that the storyline has been left in the slums to ferment.  <br />
<br />
Rico returns to his home country to take down a dictator which utilises the powerful properties of a mineral called Bavarium; which basically runs every type of device on the island. <br />
<br />
Rico is assisted by a team full of stereotypes including: a socially inept mad scientist, Rico’s dopey best friend, a generic smuggler couple, and an infuriating other guy who’s friends with the enemy for reasons unexplained.<br />
<br />
An uninspired story with uninspired twists creates a disappointing ending as well as tasteless and random changes in tone, such as a stupid cow-kissing scene almost immediately following a terrorist attack that left many innocents dead. <br />
<br />
But despite the missions all feeling the same (blow up the bad guys or protect the vehicle), Avalanche has done a reasonable job making up reasons for these missions. An awesome initial cutscene and some fairly humorous dialogue also helps to save the story from being a complete waste of time.
