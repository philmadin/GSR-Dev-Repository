Eight months on from the destruction of Requiem (the forerunner planet from Halo 4) the Chief is back in action with members of his Original Spartan II squad, Blue Team. Simultaneously we follow Fireteam Osiris lead by Sergeant Locke who is accompanied by fan favourite Edward Buck, voiced and modelled after actor/Halo fan Nathan Fillion (Firefly, Castle, Halo ODST).<br />

Following a similar format to Halo 2, our stories fling back and forth between The Master Chief and Spartan Locke. Choosing to split the story arc will, again, divide the audience, especially given that the Master Chief does not receive even half his usual content. In fact, there are only a total of three missions that allow you to take the reigns of the series hero. Given the nature of the plot and the large amount of unknowns, especially towards the end, it would have been interesting to spend more time with the Chief. Considering the events that unfold and how they tie to Chief, it’s a missed opportunity not to allow him more of the stage.
