You play as William "B.J." Blazkowicz, a veteran of the Wolfenstein series, trusted with the job of infiltrating a Nazi stronghold and obtaining important documents which would be vital in undermining the Nazi regime. <br />
<br />
The insanity and hilarity that follows as you attempt to complete this task has become an iconic tradition for developers, MachineGames, as you will often find yourself performing brutal takedowns, taking part in exhilarating hand-to-hand combat and wielding two weapons at once in thrilling shootouts, all underscored with B.J’s incredibly dry humour.<br />
<br />
The characters you meet along the way make for a reasonably immersive world, making the player feel as if they are actually playing an integral part in the downfall of the Nazi’s.
