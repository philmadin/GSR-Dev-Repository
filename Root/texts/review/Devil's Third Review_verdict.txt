Devil’s Third is a mixed bag. While the single-player is a mediocre experience with some nice ideas, the multiplayer is a quality mode that is tarnished with the addition of micro transactions. <br />

In all, I recommend either waiting for a price drop – or simply choose the PC version instead. Hopefully, if Valhalla chooses to make a sequel, it’ll take such criticisms on board and create a genuinely excellent experience.
