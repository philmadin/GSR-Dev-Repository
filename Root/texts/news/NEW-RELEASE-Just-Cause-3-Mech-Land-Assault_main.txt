JUST CAUSE 3: MECH LAND ASSAULT - the second content pack from the Air, Land and Sea Expansion Pass - is now available for everybody, and there’s a brand new animated launch trailer to mark the occasion.

The launch trailer, released today, shows Just Cause’s signature destruction realised in an animated style, as Rico’s mechanized loader punches a helicopter out of the sky.
